So u can buy them for a certain amont of riot points or even mastery points, so you have to play the champ for example up to 50 k an get the old champion icon as a reward.

13,TIP: Leave your client logged out while patching for much better system performance!,"I ran some tests, and CPU usage is doubled and RAM usage goes from 45mb to 603mb average while LOGGED IN ON CLIENT WHEN ITS PATCHING. This is because the logged out client uses nearly no RAM compared to logged in because nothing is loaded, and the CPU usage is doubled because the logged in client also needs a passive CPU usage of its own, while a logged out client needs nearly nothing. Disk usage is unchanged whether logged in or out. 

I hope this can help a lot of you out if you don't want to use the client but just download the patch ASAP so you can play with minimal system performance. Sorry if this does not work for you, these are just tests I ran on my PC. Thanks!

24,Azael vs Drakos: One redditor's opinion on why EUphoria is better than the Dive (currently),"Hey Folks,

Just wanted to throw this out here since it's 2 in the morning (PST) and since I couldn't sleep, I figured I'd write this out. As my name and timezone would suggest, I am an NA fan, but I like consuming league content from both EU and NA. However, with the departure of Jatt from the Dive, the show has changed quite a bit and not for the best. It's clear that Azael and Kobe are trying to find their groove with a key voice leaving the group, but I wanted to offer some suggestions with EUphoria as an example because the EU league show, like the rest of the LEC, has been FIRE. 

Now, here's what I like about EUphoria. Drakos and Froskurinn are great at asking questions, getting the discussion to move forward, and getting the most OUT of their guests. Drakos in particular has experience hosting the show from the play in stages of MSI and worlds, and his host experience really comes out when you watch/listen to EUphoria. He gives his opinion, but also leaves room for others to fill up the space and doesn't really dominate the discussion.

What kills me about the Dive is that Azael is the opposite. To his credit, he is very knowledgeable about the game, but his presentation of these ideas are akin to stream of consciousness, where his points have points on top of them that it leaves no space for others to really talk about. 

Here are some examples pulled from this seasons episodes (Yes, Azael and Kobe acknowledged the interview format didn’t work, but my samples are a reflection on *how* Azael communicates in general):

[Here](https://youtu.be/iYgnVlk2STg?t=2333) Azael brings up a funny scrim anecdote, but then throws a lengthy question at WildTurtle. 

[This](https://youtu.be/3z8B1FTkZ0M?t=648) clip is Azael discussing imports, and his point is made clear early on that he's arguing korean imports have drawbacks, but it's drawn out longer than it needs to be. 

[Lastly](https://youtu.be/iYgnVlk2STg?t=2570) this clip just highlights a trend I've noticed in the Dive where Azael puts forth so much information, there's not much for anyone else to add so the discussion halts there. 

Obviously these are just minute samples from hour long episodes, but in general I've felt that the listening experience to the Dive has not been smooth, and I feel that Azael has room to grow as a host/facilitator of discussion. I've never had this thought cross my mind while listening to EUphoria, so perhaps getting that host training or entering the Dive with a more host mindset can help improve the show. 

With all this being said, I want to make this first disclaimer clear that I do NOT want people to take this as time to flame Azael. I think he's a great color caster, but when it comes to the Dive specifically, I feel that he has areas he can improve on, and I wanted to bring up Drakos as just one counter example. 

Secondly, it's important to note that the Dive and EUphoria are different shows in nature. The Dive is a discussion with the same set of people focusing on the LCS, meta changes and other broader topics. EUphoria on the other hand is more of a radio/interview show that tailors their episodes to the new guests they have every week, so we get more team specific insight. The Dive tried this show format earlier this year, but it wasn't well received due in part to the issues I've brought up. 

Still, the fact that these two shows in their present form are fundamentally different is important to keep in mind in the sense that Azael can't just be a carbon copy of Drakos, but there are things he can learn to make the Dive a smoother show. Azael, if you do end up reading this, I wish you nothing but the best, and I hope this criticism helps future episodes. 

Edit: Just to be clear, my post is about Azael’s style of communication and his tendency to present so much information that it doesn’t lend itself to further discussion. I am *not* suggesting the Dive should be more like EUphoria or that they go back to the interview style.

32,"7 hours from the time this is posted, CK playoffs kick off. The winner will join KT, Jin Air and ES Sharks in LCK relegation tournament. A preview of what to expect.","Hey all. I imagine most of you don't watch Challengers Korea (CK), the Korean secondary league. This year has been a rather interesting one, as several familiar names have made a career comeback and last year's relegated teams entirely rebuilt their rosters. Below is a summary of the league format, the top five teams this split and what to expect out of the upcoming promotion tournament.

&amp;#x200B;

**Format**

Before anything, I have to explain the way the league is actually structured and how the teams get promoted. There's eight teams competing in a double round robin, 10 Week split. Every match is a Bo3. The first placed team at the end of the split gets to skip playoffs and automatically qualifies for the promotion tournament. Teams 2-5 get to face off in a single elimination bracket with Bo5 series play, similar to LCS semi-finals. The winner will join the promotion tournament. Now for the teams.

**ES Sharks**

Spring's number one team has been in CK since 2018. After being denied a chance to go to promotions in both Spring and Summer, ES Sharks entirely rebuilt their roster coming into 2019. You may remember this team getting beat by fellow CK team BBQ Olivers in Kespa Cup. However, before the split kicked off, midlane and support were replaced by LCK  veterans Kuzan and GuGer. Kuzan has been the best midlaner and arguably the best player of the Spring Split, leading in MVP standings for most of the split and dismantling most of the inexperienced midlaners coming in this split. Toplaner Jisu has also been very dominant in his role and is the front runner for best toplaner. ES Sharks kicked off the season very dominantly, going 4-0, before dropping their match against APK Prince 1-2 and almost losing against middling team Brion Blade 2-1 as well. After this, ES Sharks would go on to win most matches (while dropping some games along the way), until managing to beat rivals APK Prince 2-1 in Week 10. This secured first place overall with an overall record of of 21-10.

**APK Prince**

APK are the Korean equivalent of that Cloud 9 Challenger team that was four veterans plus Contractz. Except it's five LCK veterans making a comeback and renewing their careers. Errsu (formerly Ikksu), KaKAO, Mickey, Fury and Secret are all seasoned LCK veterans, some of whom have spent time over seas. Unlike ES Sharks, APK started off shaky, going 3-5 in the first two weeks, even dropping their match against the struggling BBQ Olivers. After this, they would go on to beat ES Sharks and start on a 2-0 rampage against most teams in the league before finally dropping a single game to Brion Blade in Week 9. They would conclude the split with a close 1-2 loss to ES Sharks, with an overall record of 24-8. They were overall the most dominant team in the league, but did not clinch first place because their match score was lower than that of the ES Sharks. They will face BBQ Olivers in the first round of playoffs.

**VSG**

This is probably the one team I know the least about, as I missed most of their matches. This is one of the rosters that frequently subs players in and out during matches. Notably, the roster includes two maligned players in SoaR and Mightybear, both LCK Veterans. Midlaners reM and Ruby are rookies, while the botlane of Veritas and Minit have some experience in various teams, with Veritas having spent some time on Unicorns of Love. From what I've seen, Ruby is a pretty decent mid, while Veritas and Minit occasionally pop-off in some games. VSG as a whole started off comfortably at 4-2, losing only to Brion, but beating APK. VSG are overall a shaky team looking at standings. Despite being third, they went 1-1 with all teams, only being able to 2-0 the two worst teams in the league. Notably, they either went 2-0 or 0-2 in all matches until Week 9 where they won both matches 2-1. They end the split with an 18-12 overall game score. They will face Brion in playoffs.

**Brion Blade**

Brion Blade is a team of rookies/challenger players with little in the way of recognizable names. If I had to pick out one standout name, it would be jungler Broccoli, who at one point was leading in several stats. Despite the lack of experience, they have found some form of consistency in going 1-1 with all the middling teams, beating the teams clearly worse than them, but never being able to best the top two. Brion had an uncertain start to the split, winning their first 3 matches with a 6-1 game score, but with one of the 2-0 victories coming from a forfeit match from BBQ. After this, Brion would be handed losses by APK and ES Sharks, but would continue with victories against bottom teams. This changed in the second round, as they would crucially lose rematches against BBQ and VSG, netting them an overall 19-17 game score.

**BBQ Olivers**

Besides APK Prince, this is probably the most recognized team by Western fans, as BBQ were formerly an LCK team with an uncanny ability to take matches off top teams and having a great logo. This team received some attention in off-season, as they became the first Korean team to import  non-Koreans in jungler Malice and coach LS. They would also import an NA mid (yes, really) known as Deus. Despite being listed as a midlaner, Deus would mostly sub in for toplaner HeoKong. BBQ matches were always interesting because of their draft. Lack of Annie mid aside, Malice would frequently draw Evelynn and Karthus bans, enabling some pretty unique picks such as Kled jungle, Pantheon/Taliyah bot, Neeko ADC and even Mordekaiser support. However, BBQ struggled throughout the season. They kicked off the first two weeks with a 2-5 game score, managing to beat APK, but losing to ES Sharks and forfeiting a match to Brion Blade due to health problems for some players. Things continued downward until they manged to 2-0 VSG in Week 4. Seemingly in a reverse of fortune, despite beating top teams, BBQ would lose matches to the worst teams in the league. They would go 1-1 with all teams except ES Sharks, who beat them twice (but not without dropping a game in the rematch). They finish with an overall record of 17-18.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction**

Given the state of the bottom LCK teams, I am almost certain that Jin Air will be relegated and that APK Prince will be in LCK next split. When it comes to KT and ES Sharks, it's a tossup. Despite having BDD and Smeb, KT do not hold a definite advantage in the solo lanes as both players have struggled, especially Smeb who has recently been subbed out for Kingen. BDD has shown moments of brillance and is most often the reason KT win, but he will be facing the best midlaner in CK. Still, the experience of the players may pull through if the ES Sharks rookies prove to be a liability.

As for the actual CK Playoffs, if anyone can pull an upset, it's BBQ. They are 3-3 with APK coming into series and finished with a victory, while APK lost their last match. VSG will most certainly beat Brion and advance.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR**

Predicting a Jin Air relegation, an APK Promotion and a tossup for the last spot between KT and ES Sharks. BBQ has some potential to upset APK in playoffs, but they will probably lose and continue to grow for CK Summer.

36,"Ornn's rework failed hard in making him reasonable in soloQ relative to his pro play power. He sees some pro play but has 45,6% WR in soloQ.","Stats i use are from U.GG which some rioters have said to best reflect their internal data, but its not like Ornn is looking much better in other stats sites.

Ornn was way too team dependent before his rework which made it impossible to balance him for both soloQ and pro play. He was meta in pro while being completely unplayable in soloQ with 45% WR and his current situation is way too close to that.

The rework helped him in some ways like giving lategame damage which is a lot more valuable in soloQ but it also took a huge step backwards by putting more power to the items he gives allies for free. 

Taking power directly away from him and making him instead inflate ally stats was a huge mistake as the champion was already way too supportive. Ornn needs massive soloQ buffs that wont break him in pro play and its really hard to do when he has a mechanic that literally takes power from him and donates it to carries, a transfer that is more powerful with a coordinated team.

Tanks are inherently supportive and stronger in pro play and having one also directly lose power to give to others is just way too much. Ornn needs to be less useful to his team and stronger alone if he ever wishes to not be a troll pick in soloQ. Its not like he is some super mechanical champion that can be even remotely balanced with close to 45% winrate.",leagueoflegends

# NOTES

A) Though they are officially designated separate universes, the following universes contain references to one another, which implies that they take place in the same world.

* Pulsefire + Everything *(While not exactly the same universe, it must be stated that Pulsefire time travelers have access to all other universes, officially combining all LoL AUs into a single multiverse.)*
* Event Horizon + Odyssey *(Odyssey Kayn's Rhaast is a servant of the Dark Star.)*
* K/DA + Pentakill *(Evelynn claims to take inspiration from Karthus. DJ Sona exists here as well, despite also being a member of Pentakill. Multiple talents!)*
* Winter Wonder + Sugar Rush *(Dark Candy Fiddlesticks seems to exist in both. Possibly a mistake.)*
* Omen of the Dark + Eclipse *(Again, not the same world, but OotD is a storybook fable in the Eclipse universe.)*

Please note that easter eggs in splash arts and interactive voice lines do not necessarily imply a shared universe. Additionally, [it's been stated](https://twitter.com/notquitefrodo/status/1060597470277718016) that elements of the musical universe and Culinary Masters can bleed into other universes, hence why every universe seems to have a Pentakill poster, etc. Pulsefire Ezreal claims that the show Culinary Masters exists in over 50 universes.

B) I've chosen to omit a number of universes/sets due to the fact that they are extremely self-explanatory, or could hardly be called universes at all. (Example: Pool Party. It's a pool party. You get it.) I also opted not to include universes containing two or fewer skins, such as Thunder Lord. Additionally, a lack of official clarification has left the boundaries of some universes unclear, such as Lunar Revel and Bilgewater. To avoid speculation, I have omitted these as well. If you disagree with any of these omissions, I'd love to hear why.

C) While skins are officially listed by universe within the game client (you can find them under Collection &gt; Skins &gt; Set &gt; Universe), the page is in desperate need of love and has not incorporated newly released skins in some time. I did a lot of digging for this post, so please let me know if I missed anything, and I will update as necessary.

Hope you enjoy.

# FAQs

**Where are you getting this info?**

Official skin descriptions and other official texts, most of which I found in the client and on the wiki. I've also been informed by tweets and other public posts from Rioters. None of this is speculation on my part.

**Doesn't Sandstorm Ekko belong in Guardian of the Sands?**

Nope. Why they dumped Pyke in that universe but not Ekko is beyond me. They did my boy dirty. Please stop asking me this.

**Doesn't X skin belong in Y universe?**

Probably not, sorry. I can't respond to all of these individually but I encourage you to do your own research.

**Where are the rest of the Snowdown skins?**

The Snowdown universe comes in three sets: Snowdown, Snow Day, and Winter Wonder. I chose to include Winter Wonder and omit the other two because I felt that the latter fell under the ""self-explanatory"" category (see Note B). Winter Wonder actually has some interesting lore, whereas Snowdown and Snow Day... don't. Despite technically existing in the same universe, they're just Christmas skins. You get it.

82,How do you main something?,"Hello there, I'm beginning to get frustrated at my inconsistency in league of legends. I get bored of playing the same champ over and over, since I began, I focused on playing the hardest champions in League, lots of skillshots, lots of abilities, and so on. One thing I seem to not be able to do; it's like I hate winning, once I get pretty good at a champion I get bored of it, I see people making plays with other champions and they steal me, I will get to playing that champion and so on.

85,There should be a tutorial for what items to buy and when,"Kind of a vent, but this is actually a real suggestion; I suggest that Riot add a small tooltip saying that if you feel you lack the damage, and there are other damage dealers on the team, you should try to build tankier items. I have lost many a game where a 1/8 nunu jg or support lux still builds full AP (the 0 stack Mejai strat) despite having more fed, more realiable damage dealers on the team. It's just one small tooltip that can remind people to itemize more efficiently if they want to win...

92,It might be interesting/nice to get some skins for the poor Scruttler crabs and all the different plants.,"I mean, they deserve some promotions after getting bullied hundreds of thousands of times every god damn day by us the summoners of the rift.

How many of you found the enemies invading your jg by slapping the sperms out of the Scryer's Bloom? How many of your ignited asses were saved by eating the fruits that you smashed out of the Honey fruit after a lux support QWERD your face from the bot-lane river bush. How many of you, have gain tremendous amount of advantage in gold, vision and experience by furiously beating our Rift Scuttler, the pacifist. 

This is why we can have a ""scuttler crab and plants upgrade system"". It refreshes monthly. They get better looking skins when people use them more in that week or month. 

Maybe near the end of every month, we can have a competition between servers on the skins we got for our crabs and plants. The end of every month would be Scuttle-and-Plants Appreciation Day. 

The point is that they have been exploited. They deserve some love and attention.",leagueoflegends

95,Season 9 Ranked has really been a journey.,"We all know about positional ranked got implemented and removed. There was the whole issue with MMR's being too high and platinum/diamond players climbing to high masters.  
While fixing that, I was demoted to diamond 4 when they did the Diamond+ reset.  


Even further, I was demoted to platinum 1 from decay yesterday morning.  
Riot Support Tweet about the issue: [https://twitter.com/RiotSupport/status/1113542462817984512](https://twitter.com/RiotSupport/status/1113542462817984512)

I was promoted back to diamond 4 late last night.

100,Study on the correlation of rank and aggression/self-esteem of League of Legends players,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a high-school student currently doing a research paper on LoL rank and its correlation with aggression and self-image. Let's start off with why I'm even interested in this topic.

&amp;#x200B;

I have played games since I was ten years old. From humble beginnings playing Mario Bros. on the Gameboy Colour to now being an avid League player with 6 seasons of experience in my bag. You don't have to be here for that long to hear or see various speculations  regarding toxicity and its variance through the ranks. However, I never found any conclusive results. To try to get some answers I decided that I will do my final year psychology research paper on the correlation between League of Legends rank and aggression and self-esteem. In essence, I am just measuring your aggression, self-esteem and of course rank.

This questionnaire is completely anonymous and will take you less than 5 minutes, which means you can easily fill it out while waiting for a game. Every participant counts.

Here is the link:

 [**https://www.1ka.si/a/211812**](https://www.1ka.si/a/211812) 

&amp;#x200B;

All of the results will be posted, along with a summary of the paper in English.

Thank you for taking the time to answer the questions. Best of luck in your S9 games!

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to post them in the comments or shoot me a PM.

Rito has been systematically nerfing him in EVERY. SINGLE. PATCH. The latest nerfs to Dark Seal and buffs to Wit's End have got to be the final nail in the coffin. 

I remember that one patch in season 7 where Singed (after 12 hours of the patch) crept up to like 53.5% win rate and was IMMEDIATELY (within only 12 hours) hotfix nerfed. This means that logically Rito should hotfix buff Singed now, RIGHT???

117,Should Riot Sell Accounts to existing players to avoid the road from Hell?(1-30 climb),"Hey community. 

I happen to be a diamond player on NA server so I admit to knowing nothing. I just wanted to get your input on the game/account creation. I personally think that Riot could make a better way to level up accounts for players who already have an existing account. While I believe that it is important for new players to level up and actually ""learn"" the game. (objectives, dragon control, playing around teammates, etc...) I think that as a returning player and for most of us in the community leveling up new accounts is a horrendous experience. As I am not in the LPP program because I am not a big streamer, I think Riot could potentially make a better way for players to level up or obtain new accounts.  One of which would be to sell accounts that are level 25 or 30 for about 50-100 dollars. In order to do this, you already have to have an account that is already level 30, is not banned, and you would have to do some sort of check to via email or something to verify it. I think you should be able to pick which champions are on it within reason. Ie you cant pick 10 6300 blue essence champs. you could pick 3 6300, or like 5 4800 blue essence champions. I find myself often unable to play with my friends because they are low ranks, had I an alternate account I could play an off role that I am not the best at. I am aware of the aspect of smurfing and the idea of this and I completely understand the repercussions of why certain people would not want this. That is why I would implement that you could only create an account every (6 months or year). Personally, I think it should be around 50, because of the idea that RIOT is allowing you to buy an account as well as its 50$ essentially to just skip the cancerous hassle of playing 30 games with out flash or without a jungle. This is just a rough draft/idea that I had thought of after watching multiple streamers complain pre- LPP program that the level up for existing players is cancer. Let me know what you guys think about the pricing, the amount of champions, or whatever you guys think!

120,Huge ranked distribution changes in diamond+ after ranked reset.,"As you can tell from the source below, in February diamond+ was the top 2.82% of players which was still a huge change from last season being top 1.5% of players. But, since the ranked reset (which was supposed to fix ranked and bring it back to normal/get rid of the players that don't belong in diamond+), now as of march diamond+ includes top 4.1% of players. Diamond 4 alone had a jump from 1.6% of the population to 2.61% of the population in just 1 month. What is the reasoning behind diamond+ changing from top 1.5% to 2.82% and finally now top 4.1% of the player base. Getting to diamond used to be an achievement, but now it feels like riot really messed up ranked by adding so many plat players into diamond.

122,"The coach of the split has been announced, but I think there is a name sourly missing.","Youngbuck

He has transformed Fnatic from a one-trick-pony (in 2017) into a well rounded a versitile team. When a team makes a 180 like that so often does the team religh on a one dimensional strategy. When that gets figured out they are out of options. But that is not what Youngbuck opted to do. Fnatic is now a well rounded team. Their macro is some of the finest in Europe and their diversity in playstyle is almost second to non. I have seen a lot of teams fail where Fnatic stood a few weeks ago. Yet this is the first time I have truly seen a team go from 0 to 10 that quickly. With stellar progression every week. 

Guilhoto might have shaped Origen into a tittle contender, with solid macro to boot. But Youngbuck has repeatedly made champions out of every team he has worked with and he is the only western coach I have seen that has made huge turnarounds on every lineup he has worked with. 

I would end it here, but I also want to quickly praise him for his drafts against Vitality in the best of 5, and making his team swithch playstyles that quicly to fully counter their strengths. 

I like Yamatocannon and praise Duke for his work on Splyce, but I don't think any one of them deserved to be mentioned more then Youngbuck. Especially this year I think he deserves the coach of the split award more then anybody else.

We made this to add more contrast because everything was too gold. We also change the gold shade to a lighter one, because the first one was too dark.  I'm sorry if my english isn't that good I'm brazilian so I may have made some mistakes.

143,Tool that optimises pick and ban strategies for pro teams,"Hey everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

For my honours project, I am researching on a decision support tool for the pick and ban stage of League of Legends. Currently, the final goal of this project is for professional teams to use this to make informed decisions during the pick and ban stage. The tool will be flexible and be adaptable to any team or player's current game strategy and playstyles. Sick of playing Vayne for 5 games in a row? No worries, just let the tool know and it'll adapt! Does the enemy have a God-tier support and a mediocre ADC? Let the tool know, and it will adjust the pick and ban suggestions, targeting the appropriate enemy players! 

&amp;#x200B;

I have chosen questions similar to above to ensure a flexible tool. However, I am not a professional, and so I do not know what is actually needed in a tool like this. As a result, it will benefit the research greatly if professional input is incorporated into the research and design of the tool at all stages. Thus, I am looking for any professional eSports team, coach or analyst that is interested in the tool and can assist in its development. The tool will then help any interested teams understand the game theory techniques of the pick and ban stage, creating the most optimal team compositions. ",leagueoflegends

146,Hats off to Riot on shortening game time,"Last season's marksman changes and shorter game time made the role pretty miserable. Over a long period of time, my average rank went down almost a whole tier. I wanted to own up to it but even the challenger ladder was reflecting the changes heavily with players like TF Blade and QT. 

Yet, the changes reintroduced champs like Nocturne back in the game. A champ that could get major fed before but couldn't really end games due to waveclear and tank metas reigning supreme. I remember when many others thought Karthus would never see the light of day again since tons of new champs were having ways of avoiding his ult.

Waveclear is way less ridiculous yet still good. A ton of vision has been eliminated from the game to make it much more difficult to make the ""right"" call. Tanks lost a lot of ability to 1v1 bruisers but are still valuable for teamfight and and facechecking. At the same time, tons of assassins still have ways to pop the backline thanks to more damage, less gold on supports, and less vision. Teamfights are also way shorter and have way more key moments rather than just marksman going Rambo on the tanks for an eternity. Shorter teamfights make untargetable assassins much more viable in them as well. Also, the new PD has been a godsend for marksmen due to the uncoordinated nature of solo q. And now we just got Wit's End as well to stack.

It's wild what Riot have accomplished when last year, so many players were complaining about the game but admitted they had no idea how to fix it. No one liked the bounties (especially CS) at first. Yet you can hear more people owning up to giving a fat bounty to a late-game carry rather than complaining. We all wanted shorter games without it being absurdly snowbally and feeling so helpless. Now we have a pretty good amount of diversity in early and late game champs. It feels amazing to not play hour long, soul-taxing games. The game finally has reclaimed that special depth to it that everyone loves.",leagueoflegends
148,The best ADC ever debate,"Hi I usually hang around inven more often than here in reddit in terms of league community, but there is recently a debate that has been going on in inven about who the best player is for each position. debate on ADC position was the most popular of them. inven's most popular opinion was that Bang is the best ever over UZI. It might be because its a Korean community. which got myself wondering why the opinion is so different from here  and inven on who the best ADC is. I've searched up some posts that i could find on reddit about this matter and i have noticed more people would say Uzi is the best adc ever over bang. 

I did not watch every game of LPL and Uzi's career. I watched league for that span of years but did not really pay attention to him. but I can say i did watch alot of LCK games and worlds. I do realize League of legends is a team game, but If I remember correctly, uzi's team was almost always highly praised, and considered as one of the teams that could win it all. Again, i do not know the details of the team and exactly what situation that they were in that led them to shortcoming at the big stages since I did not pay attention to uzi all that much. But at the end of the day, what did he actually accomplish? this is a genuine question. I did little bit of research, and realized he had fantastic year in 2018. and other than that he had number of shortcomings in international and domestic tournaments. correct me if i am wrong here, He won 2 LPL titles, 1 MSI, and 2 2nd place in worlds. And in that 'fantastic' 2018 when they were heavy favorite to win the tourny, they fell short and was knocked out in quarterfinals. 

I see that alot of people say he has crazy mechanics, and positioning skills. And in 2018, i did think too that he was the best adc at the time after listening to various casters and reading some post on league communities. But after reading the debate at inven for few days, I ve reached to a conclusion that maybe he is not good enough to take his team to the top. people might say he had bad team or there was this circumstances, that circumstances. but hes been in the scene for what, 6,7years? and during those years he definitely had the team and the chance to reach the top and leave legacy. but he couldnt. The team's game plan also factors in Uzi's performance. his team relies on the performance of Uzi. they give him all the lanes, buy times and champs so that he has chance to carry the game. And this is because uzi is that good of a player. they believe that uzi can carry the game when fed. 

trophies arent the only thing that measures players when debating on who the best player is. definitely not!. But I do not think Bang has shown anything short from what Uzi have shown. I actually think he showed much more.(again correct me if I am wrong) He performed well in any stages, and in 2015,2016 I would say he carried more games than faker did. I believe that Bang had mechanics not falling from uzi, one of the best positioning ever, and did not die easily in important fights. 

&amp;#x200B;

besides bang, I even think Uzi can be compared to PraY. He has 1 2nd place in worlds, and has won 4 times in LCK, and 1 2nd place in MSI. I think the mechanics are slightly worse than uzi's but hey, he finds ways to win and have shown multiple times of how good he can be in multiple tournaments. I am not placing Pray over Uzi but just saying, 

&amp;#x200B;

wrapping things up, Uzi is a amazing player with top tier mechanics for very long time. I think he had the team and the talent to show up in the big stage but was not able to accomplish much. I believe Bang is the best ever to play the ADC position with the skillsets and the success he has shown. But hey this is just my thoughts. I wanted to share my thoughts to this community and see what other opinions i get. ",leagueoflegends

Wouldn't it be awesome if you could hop into an ARAM game and you'd randomly get one of the two maps? For all I know, they have no difference between them other than the looks, so it wouldn't be any difference to balance them.

178,Champion play style that you miss before its rework / revamp," Hey guys,

As someone who has played since mid to late season one, I've had so many champions that I love forever changed.

Sure, a lot of them may not have been that popular, Galio etc. But I seriously loved them.

Not all of them received full on reworks where they're basically different champions (Galio, Sion etc).

Some just had tweaks to their spells that changed what you maxed and their playstyle etc. For example, old Fizz his Q was insane. Feels kinda bad (for me) to play him now, where the main meta is to max E etc.

My top 5 champs I miss how they were:

1. Twitch (iirc he had like 60second stealth from Q, was fucking awesome, they also couldn't see you without pink wards etc). Also for me his old voice and lines. His new ones seem kinda cringe. And the ult. Spray n Pray
2. Galio, his Q just felt amazing to hit, huge instant burst. Not the most popular champion but I played him mid/ top/ support with pretty good success, like 60% wr. Loved his old ult...
3. Eve, her old stealth and ult.
4. Old GP. Sure, the new GP is much more skill capped and probably rewarding I think. Many of the older champions were much simpler, but I just never really got into this whole barrel-business.
5. Old Nidalee. Yeah the 80% of your HP spears were a bit ridiculous and the heal was OP, but was so satisfying landing a max range Q. Also shoutout to AD nidalee bruiser.

183,Some ideas to improve the clubsystem,"Hey people,

&amp;#x200B;

i'm the owner of the K/DA ""Fanclub""-club on EUW (100 Members + 10+ on a waitinglist) and thought about some ways to have a better clubexpirience in League.

English is not my main language but i'm trying to make everything as clear as possible :)

&amp;#x200B;

1. A Textbox on the mainpage of the Club

Give us an option to leave a permanent text, for example a bunch of rules, discord invitelinks etc, on the mainpage of the club.

&amp;#x200B;

2. A Message of the day system

This is a feature for Owners/Officers only.  
Adding a textbox, for those who have access to it,wich sends automaticly a message to the clubchat once every 24 Hours.

This is a good way to announce internal events or giveaways.

&amp;#x200B;

3. More individual Ranks

There's no role except for the officer rank to assign, i wish we had an option to create individual roles to give people

only the ability to invite but not to kick. Ranks like Council, Captain, Manager etc.

&amp;#x200B;

4.Clubtiers, Tax, Clubquests &amp; Milestones

&amp;#x200B;

This is something i really really REALLY would like to have and is an idea to improve the play-together expirience.

Adding tiers to clubs with milestones leveleup up by sharing the gained expirience per game to the club.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me try to explain this a little bit more indepth :

&amp;#x200B;

Clubs are currently just a tag and a name, nothing else.

But how about adding a rank to clubs starting at Iron 1 to whatever with rewards at each tier-milestone.

You can level up by offering tax to your club or by doing daily clubquests.

&amp;#x200B;

Tax :

You, as an owner, can chose members to share 10% to 50% of their earned expirience (excluding first win of the day) to increase the clubs rank. 

&amp;#x200B;

Clubquests :

Can only be done with clubmembers in your party.

Each person can participate only at one quest per day.

There's a Questboard on the clubpage in the client, listing 3 daily tasks with clubexp and blue essences as rewards.

&amp;#x200B;

Tier rewards :

Each division could grant 5 additional members and each tier adds an additional daily quest per day.

&amp;#x200B;

   5. Add a function to search for clubs.

&amp;#x200B;

Give people the chance to find a community by looking for certain keywords/tags :(

It’s almost like Jatt was the glue. It’s also becoming apparent in the Dive where Azael hardcore tunnels on TSM’s long game time average without pointing out any substance as to why they are long. They also say that C9 will win because Licorce is way stronger than BB. While I agree Licorce is better the difference is not as big as they are claiming it to be. The difference between them is about the same as Bjerg vs Nisqy. You can also say that Zven/Smoothie are better than Sneaky/Zeyzal so TSM has two winning lanes while C9 has 1

Indeed, the long range of his uncounterable execution ult give him a bit too much decisive mechanic in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

What I would suggest is basically to make his ult a reverse hook. In the current state, he grabs the target to his belly and delete it. In my theory, **he would be the one rushing to the target.** 

Therefore , he would have to think twice, thrice or frice to reactivate his ult and delete a target. This would as well fit with the fear mechanism which is currently not really usefull (except for ULT+ flash in).

225,[Discussion] Most of the legendary skins have an egocentric personality,"Okay, I'm not sure how to name it but I've been noticing for quite a while that legendary skins tend to have this kind of personality. Lets put an example: Nightbringer Yasuo.

""I light the way to your darkness.""
""I am your abyss.""
""I am the wind of change.""

These are just a few of the multiple quotes he has referring to him as the all consuming chaos and how powerful he is BLA BLA BLA. Don't get me wrong, I love the legendary skins. But, I find it kind of interesting why most of them resemble so much in personality.",leagueoflegends

234,24 hour purchase limit sucks,"so i dropped $100 on rp prepaid cards (kinda dumb for a new player, but i couldn't resist the furry capsules uWu)

the store i bought the rp cards from only had $25 doller cards so i had to get 4 (i wanted to get the 10pack furry capsules and then use the rest on a couple legends coinciding with whatever cool skins i get)

turns out there is a limit, and when i went to go enter the 4th card i got told i need to wait 24 hours i have reached my purchase limit. figuring this might have been a bug with 9.7patch downtime coming up later that night. so after the patch went live i tried it again and received the same message. i tried support to see if they can wave the 24 hour period. turns out they cant. also what i learned from support is that every time you try and make a purchase in said 24 hour period, it will reset back to a whole 24 hours. so now i gotta wait till tomorrow (2 days after i had purchased $100 rp) to be able to use the rest of my rp so that i can use the skins that i got for dropping $100.

its a pretty petty problem, but its still frustrating. i have no clue why the purchase limit would be such a low number.  this has been an unpleasant experience, and i am not likely to ever buy rp again. ",leagueoflegends

But Riot doesn’t seem to plan to nerf any of these champions.

However, Morgana finally being viable in mid for 1 patch, they immediately nerf her. Same for champions like Sylas.

Why is there such favoritism in Riot? Is it all about selling skins? I know Riven Anni Draven are supper popular champions with a lot of skins to sell.

On 9.7, Instead of lowering/changing some numbers around and/or reverting the CD buff they gave vayne that broke her and give her a healthier buff, they've decided to instead buff tank items and runes to get tanks to be played more to give a reason for vayne to be as strong as she is. So now whenever someone brings up that [vayne's pickrate, banrate and winrate](https://u.gg/lol/champions/vayne/build/) [are too high](https://u.gg/lol/champions/vayne/build/?rank=diamond_plus), they can now just say ""well tanks are being played more so it only makes sense that she's this strong.""

*(Just to be clear, I'm happy that tank items were buffed. In fact, tanks have been a bit subpar* ***in solo queue*** *for quite some time now, and this should make them feel alot better. I just hope riot doesn't use this as a ""we don't need to do anything about vayne now that tanks are played more/back into the meta.""

1. How people enjoy watching the cowman relish in his mash Q plays and/or rage when a champ beats his auto Q?

I understand the game is frustrating but don't complain about champs that you actually need to think on, when you main a champ where the game plan is running into the enemy team with R on and mashing Q on the squishes until you or the enemy dies.  


Maybe its just Yi the champ that's annoying but feel cowman's reactions/complaints when he is playing something, IMO, so simple makes it worse.

251,a few suggestions for the practice mode,"the practice mode have been for a while and it does achieve its job of helping players practice mechanical stuff (mostly skill related) but it could be improved even further 

so the practice dummies are coded as champions but they stand still, they do absolutely nothing what if we could change their behavior? 

how about this: 

* **chase mode** make the dummy (or a bot) walk towards you and chase you endlessly (unless you make it stop), you can also change its movespeed, this will help ADC's to kite 

* **runaway mode** make the dummy runaway from you, this will help players test the limits of how far they can chase and understanding the basics of movespeed and the importance of base values 

* **dodge mode** bot uses advanced scripting to help players learn to land skillshots and understanding the basics of skillshots, it can also just be made to move a lot without a specific pattern or one that imitates players most common behaviors against skillshots 

* **fire mode** every 2 secs the dummy will throw an ezreal Q to the player, AA's from the player to the dummy can turn off or on the aggresion from the dummy or also with a button (it also toggles the AA switch), all 4 dummies can be on this mode just like in the other modes  for extra challenge and you can reduce the cooldown of the dummy Q's based of your cooldown reduction (from items) 

* **replace dummy with a champion** this will probably need more work and a warning that it will make the game restart but its worth it because some champions have an AI for them from vs IA games that can be used for them to use their abilities like blitzcrank's Q or malphite's ult 

the best part of this is that you can turn on or off all of these modes at the same time (having chase and runaway mode will make the dummy avoid you if you walk towards it or chase you if you run away from it) 

these are pretty basic commands, they can be binded to 1 - 0 numbers on the keyboard or the zxcv line so players can have control of the dummy at all times 

* **allow friends to spectate a player in the practice mode with no delay** think about the posibilities, a coach can see a player cs and figure out whats its wrong and how to fix it and with these new modes it can help players improve a lot with supervision, it can also help a coach to make its players watch him so he can show a specific mechanic 

* **allow players to stack runes instantly** this is so you can test runes like ravenous hunter and overgrowth (it will default to a reasonable amount) 

what do you think about it guys? practice mode has a lot of room to improve and we should help on improving it ",leagueoflegends

The old one felt so much cleaner to cast and the new one feels so much clunkier. Do y'all think this was a needed change? I know Wukong doesn't get much love, but this feels so unnecessary.",leagueoflegends
274,When Did League of Legends Change?,"These are my thoughts on League from what I have seen.

I started back in season 2. I was instantly hooked after a few bot games. Wukong was the first champion I played and from there on, every other champion felt unique and fun. From levels 1-30, I only played bots, going from beginner to intermediate and honing my skills. Once I hit 30, it was time to start normals. The idea of playing against actual people was intimidating. Can't recall the role I played but it was back when you had to call your role. Over time, it became normals then into ranked. The elo system was new to me, especially for a first time competitive video game. Everything was new, fresh, and unique. I played with my room mates in college and we all had a great time. I was addicted for sure, but this was also compounded with depression and personal issues. None the less, I loved the game. 

From what I remember, there were the occasional trolls that would pick bad champs or feed. Most the time, this was only in normals. Season 2 ended with 2 friends and I getting trying to 10-0 the 3v3 placements to hit gold for the sweet Victorious Janna skin. We did 10-0 our last shot before the season ended, but ended silver. This drove me to try harder to be Gold for next season. Not sure when elo became mmr and the system changed, but I was okay with it. Most people weren't but after so many seasons, you just get used to it. Season 3 hit and of my group, only one friend and I remained playing duo bot lane. I played Draven back when his bleeding passive was so good you could be bad and just roll lane. I hit Gold season 3 and wanted to be better. Around season 3 or 4, I entered a school tournament and ended up taking 2nd place and love the atmosphere. I really wanted 1st of course, but the loss made me that much more excited to play. Eventually I met some other people that also played, and we started playing 5v5 normals and ranked. Again, this dropped down to only 3 then just myself. From season 3 to season 7 I was placed into Gold. Season 7 was when I noticed the change.

Around season 5/6 I met another person that played league and we began duo queue ranked. This started my shift from jungle/mid to support. I enjoyed support mostly because the synergy with my friend in the bot lane. We tried so hard to hit plat but always got stuck in Gold due to lack of time or being content in Gold for the end of season rewards. In my opinion, Ardent Censor meta was the most fun time in league of legends. Some say it made non-ardent supports useless while just snowballing the carry out of control. I agree, but games felt insanely different yet fun. I could play Nami, Sona, Janna, Lulu, or Soraka and just play differently because I knew lane phase was the most important part of the game. League changed a lot and so did I but Season 8 and 9 have been the most miserable experiences so far. I'm sure some of my time line is mixed up, but 8 years kinds of blends together. Now to the changes.

I remember people trying hard to win in Ranked. Of course there are toxic players and inters in every season, but 8 and 9 just feels like a coin flip no matter what you do. I tried so hard to not be a keyboard warrior. I would report everyone for inting; I never used to do these things because I genuinely felt like everyone actually wanted to play and get better. Season 8 was a mess. I finally hit Plat 5. After so many years, I did it. But not after struggling so hard in Gold 1. Every other day was a win streak into a loss streak. My friend and I would always say, ""well i'm in promos, ready to lose?"" because every promo game felt like an uphill battle. Top/jungle dies early, everyone else is okay, but they tilt so hard they just give up and feed. This eventually became every game. Every game was a 50/50 chance that it was once sided. The amount of close games was 1 in 20 and season 9 has been even worse. Games are unplayable because of language barriers and lack of motivation. Luckily cheating isn't as big an issue as say Apex. I remember Apex Legends release was so powerful that the views on Twitch were double Leagues. Now, Apex has cheating issues and people are less inclined to play. Eventually I turned to Apex, and have enjoyed it but I miss League. I can't uninstall, but I have no one that actually wants to play anymore. When did ranked become so one sided. Even in high elo, streamers have such one sided games that it's boring to watch. I am proud to climb from silver to plat and realize I am in the low elo, but I'd rather be low elo having fun rather than play a game and have 1 person not try making the game unplayable for their team. I have bad games and I understand that, but these aren't just bad games. People voice that they don't care anymore, but why lock yourself into 20 mins just to lose. I miss when people actually put their heart into it. I don't think I will be playing much league anymore. My duo would rather play Apex and I just want to enjoy the game again. Even ranked flex is unbearable. Every time I try to encourage people to try a bit better and we got this, they just say ""its just flex"". That mentality is so toxic that the game is just over. I'm sad and confused at what league has become and I just wanted to express my sadness at the state of the communities mentality. I probably won't be playing more than once a week or even once a month which is drastically different from every night. I always thought I could hit Diamond, but with games being one sided, its hard to get motivated to queue up solo or even duo. Thanks for reading, and for those still playing, enjoy.

279,ARAM Bans - Love or Hate?,"It boils down to 2 sides of a coin. Love or Hate having bans in ARAM?


And I strongly believe your opinion on the matter will revolve around this question. - What's more important to you, NOT having to face an annoying champ on the opposing team. Or having an amazing champ to play yourself?


For me personally IF I have to face an annoying champion on the opposing team I just put up with it and focus on dodging/out playing. I make due with what I have with an inconvenience.


However IF I get an amazing Champion I have the time of my @#!$ing life! I get super excited and have a blast playing ARAM.


I feel like Bans work in Normal Mode because you KNOW what Champion you are going to play and you KNOW you can ban that champion that annoys you. (Assuming your teammates don't want it)
However in ARAM it's random... By banning a great champ like Lux you MAY have gotten her... Or anyone on your team MAY have gotten her...


Another thing that bums me out more than anything is getting stuck with a useless champion without re-rolls.


This is my fear. - That more people will prefer to ban a Champion that would be annoying on the enemy team. Then play that champion themselves. Why ban Veigar when you can PLAY VEIGAR!!

This is terrible for me because the champions listed below will now have a much higher % of never playing again. (Keep it mind that there are a ton of very strong champions that can be played in ARAM and these are just short lists)

- Xerath
- Veigar
- Lux
- Zyra
- Ziggs
- Heim
- Brand
- Jhin
- Ashe
- Miss Fortune
Etc...


Now Champions that I personally feel aren't as good or not as fun to play will be more of a common trend 


- Talon
- Amumu
- Tryndamere 
- Garen 
- Aatrox 
Etc...


The problem is that it was super rare for me to get these amazingly fun/strong champions that now I will probably never get them and constantly be stuck with champions that bore me to death.


I do understand that with better champions banned the other champs will shine a little brighter but I still feel as if the game mode will never be as fun.


Long story short every ARAM I will ban Tryndamere and hope no one bans any fun champions... JUST IMAGINE! if everyone felt the way I did and banned 10 crappy champs. YOU GET A GOOD CHAMP YOU GET A GOOD CHAMP EVERYONE GETS A GOOD CHAMP!


If I knew that I could have gotten Ashe/Lux/Xerath but someone banned them I would be very upset

My op.gg: [https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Rizer01](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Rizer01)

Warwick has been struggling in the jungle for some time now after being nerfed due to gaining traction in this subreddit (despite being a niche pick in high elo). Those initial nerfs were fine and took Warwick from a Tier 1 pick to \~ a Tier 3 pick. However, further nerfs to Tiamat (gold increase, base AD nerfed by 5) created an instance where Warwick couldn’t keep up in farm with meta jungler (who don’t require Tiamat to clear). He is currently sitting as a Tier 5 champion in the jungle (despite being designed for jungle play). I believe he deserves better (honestly would be happy with him being a tier 3 pick).

**WHERE HAS WARWICK BEEN FORGOTTEN/LEFT BEHIND**

***Warwick has literally been missing from the entire April fools event***. There was no Warwick skin released for the Cats vs Dogs event (REALLY?) and Riot missed including joke changes in the buff/nerf list for Warwick. Ultimately, the new Wits End is an additional insult to Warwick and Warwick players, as they changed an item perfectly suited to Warwick’s kit to one that has general appeal, but has lost its identity. *Warwick’s passive was literally lifted from the champion (WW deals mgc dmg on hit, has increased healing at low hp) and placed on an item.* The changes to wits end made it LESS VIABLE on Warwick due to the magic shred amplifying his healing capabilities and DMG output (Warwick’s Q and Ult deal mgc dmg).

Of course, those are more recent changes. Overall jungle changes (scuttle, exp nerfs) put WW behind other champions. Changes to Tiamat (gold increase and -5 AD) resulted in a compensation of 2 AD back in Warwick’s kit). Keep in mind, Tiamat is the most optimal item to clear the jungle with.

286,This season/split had been the worst 3 months in league history.,"There are so many severe problems with the current ranked system and ladder it is astonishing to witness. 

My first problem, the main problem for most people is the horrid MMR system that has all but ruined this season. I see posts every day of people complaining about losing 25 and winning 13 points making it pointless to play. 

Ranked roles was a major fail and wasted a solid month and a half if you put any time on anything that wasn’t your highest rated role. 

Jungle is in such a horrible spot. I understand jungle farming last season was probably too strong due to experience but simply nerfing it by a fair margin has lessened the jungle experience severely, forcing mainly gank or objective control junglers in the meta. 

As someone who has played since season 3, I’ve seen my fair share of people complaining about stuff and that’s why it makes it hard to gauge whether this season is any different than the other ones but trust me, this season is as bad as it gets. I’m hoping for drastic changes to multiple aspects of the game to come the next split. ",leagueoflegends

As long as the Kennen doesn't commit there's no way for a melee top laner to effectively engage on him so there's no way to win the lane. It just ends up being a coinflip on who has the better teammates since there's no way to actually engage on him.

The lane is entirely up to Kennen to make a mistake, which usually has to be a pretty big one to capitalise on. Minor mistakes are very forgiving for him because of his E.

300,Guesses on the nine Shonen (Academia) skins?,"This post is just a general discussion on what I, and others may guess at what the new Shonen inspired skins will be.

&amp;#x200B;

First we'll eliminate some options. **Zed** currently has a skin on the PBE, so he's out of the contenders list. We'll also eliminate the other Academy skins as we'll assume they're in the same universe, so; **Ekko, Vladimir, Darius, Ahri, Ryze and Fiora are out.**

&amp;#x200B;

We'll also eliminate every champion that has recently gotten a skin, we'll cut it off on Nov, 2018 as I believe champs can get two skins within a year, and five months seems pretty reasonable for a champion to get another skin. So that will also eliminate; **Ivern, Fizz, Corki, Rengar, Yorick, Sejuani, Vayne, Tahm Kench, Mundo, Yi, Soraka Brand, Anivia, Nunu, Fiora,** (Already eliminated) **Vi, Aatrox, Sivir, Pyke, Camille, Lissandra, Leona, Nami, Leblanc, Graves and Fiddlesticks.**

*\[I didn't add Renekton as I don't count Hextech skins as a confirmation that you won't get another skin\]*

&amp;#x200B;

From the video we saw a couple months ago we can guess there will be nine (9) skins in total.

* One (1) Teacher. (Probably an 1820 skin) Possibly **Jhin**?
* Two (2) First Year Students.
* Two (2) Second Year Students.

&amp;#x200B;

The four available archetypes listed are; Assassin, Engineer, Sorcerer and Battle.

With it being confirmed the new champion (which will probably be revealed in two weeks) will be getting one, we can remove a Sorcerer off the list. We can also remove an Engineer (could also be Battle, but we'll leave him as Engineer) as **Jayce** recently got leaked.

&amp;#x200B;

My current guesses as to which champions will be getting the skins are;

Teacher; **Jhin.**

Assassin; **Katarina &amp;** **~~Master Yi~~**. (**Talon** and **Akali** are also pretty good guesses.)

Engineer; **Jayce &amp; Orianna.**

Sorcerer; **Unreleased New Champion &amp; Lux.** (**Syndra &amp; Neeko** have pretty good chances too.)

Battle; **Yasuo &amp; Riven.** (This one is probably the most difficult to guess as there's so many options, but **Jax &amp; Garen** are also good choices.)

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any guesses, or reasons why you think a certain champion will be included, please let me know!

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- The nine (9) champions I think will be getting the Shonen skins are; **Jhin, Katarina,** **~~Yi~~**, **Jayce, Orianna, New Support, Lux, Yasuo** and **Riven.**",leagueoflegends
301,How Much Does It Cost Riot to Make a Skin?," 

Or alternatively, how many instances of a skin does Riot need to sell to make back their money? This is not meant to be a slight on how skins are priced or the whole Prestige controversy. I'm genuinely curious. Between concept designing, modeling, creating effects, writing and voice-acting for higher tiers, and testing, how much does it cost Riot to make a skin?  
Starting with Epic, here's the price of each skin, by tier:

&amp;#x200B;

Epic (1350 RP): $9.78  
Legendary (1820 RP): $13.45 (or \~37.6% more than Epic)  
""Low"" Ultimate \[Gun Goddess Miss Fortune\] (2775 RP): $19.82 (or \~47.4% more than Legendary)  
""True"" Ultimate (3250 RP): $23.55 (or \~18.8% more than Low Ultimate)  
\*These values are derived using the minimum required RP purchases, as if the person buying the RP was only buying enough for one specific skin.

&amp;#x200B;

But of course, not all skins are made equal, even within the same tier. I think the K/DA skins had about 80 iterations or something like that. But given the success and popularity of the K/DA line, I have no doubt they made their money back and more. Then there's Elementalist Lux, a skin that demanded so much work that it made them say ""Never again."" Once again, though, since Lux is such a popular Champion, I don't think they had any issue getting their money back.

&amp;#x200B;

But the question remains: at what point, at least in general, do they start seeing a profit on a skin? 5,000? 10,000?  
Or maybe a lot sooner than that. Could it be as quickly as 1,000?  
Do some skins never make a profit and it's up to the success of other skins to make up for it?

310,Noob question: Best way to be a casual player... forever?,"Hi all,

This is a bit of an odd post but I'm gonna give it a shot: basically, I enjoy playing \~2 hours (sometimes more, sometimes less) of League a day. I'm level 27 so still a noob, and as such there are a lot of champions/roles I enjoy playing but don't do well yet because I like to mix it up every few days rather than specialise. I'm a casual player and a noob: I'm not looking to be a pro, I'm not even looking to be vaguely competitive, I just like to play and have fun, maybe improve a bit from time to time. That said, although I might watch a 10min YouTube video here and there to improve my play, I'm not dedicated to improving significantly - I kind of figure I'll just slowly get better with time. As said, I just want to play the game! 

I've found as I increase in level, the culture is getting ruder, the blow-ups worse, and the criticism harsher. I like playing draft because everyone knows their role, I like the bans, not facing my own champion in the field, etc. however this is also the level at which things seem to be nastiest at my level (since I'm not high enough to play ranked yet). I hate playing vs bots because it's so boring, but that seems to be where everyone is the most chill.

**I guess I was just wondering if there's any way to either play at lower levels, stop myself from levelling up maybe (since I feel like I'm levelling faster than I'm improving), or if perhaps playing ranked would end up being good (once I hit level 30) since then my crappy ass will be paired with other noobs. Or is it just even nastier there?** 

Overall I've really lost my desire to play because of the nastiness and the pressure to be awesome at any champion I play: I feel like if I don't get better, I just won't be able to have fun any more, but I don't want to spend my time watching other people play, that's not fun for me and I've found every stream I've watched to be completely uneducational and unhelpful, because they assume everyone watching already knows what they're doing. YouTube videos are OK but usually too long and use too much lingo.   


&amp;#x200B;

\--------

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Casual player who likes being a casual player but hates being targeted for noobiness. Looking for a way to improve my experience so I can just improve naturally and have fun, rather than feeling like I'm never good enough. Ideally I would just stop levelling up so I could catch up to where everyone else at my level is. ",leagueoflegends

The hextech hunter

Lore: 

A forgotten zaunite, with his mind transferred to a mechanical body and awakened by the curiosity of a child prodigy, has vowed to rid runeterra of whoever turned him into what he is now, in his quest he hunts whoever has a piece of hextech on them in hopes that it leads them to his target.

Pasive: Enhanced hextech rifle

Your AAs deal 15 magic damage per 250 mana and that damage turns to true damage after reaching 3000 max mana but starts consuming half the damage as mana and stops scaling.

Q- Hextech charge: (CD:10/9/8/7/6)

Channel for up to 4 seconds to boost your next basic attack consuming 2% mana/sec and increasing your next AA's range by 200(100/sec) and damage by as much mana spent during channel.

W- Hextech defenses: (CD: 15)

Passive: when shielded, recover 50% of the shield as mana and its mana cost as life.
Active: Spend 15% of your current mana to shield yourself or an ally for half the amount of mana spent for 2 seconds, if the shield is broken +20% movement speed (+10 for every 100 mana spent for the cast)

E- Hextech bullets/Hextech evolution: (Passive)

Hextech bullets: Every 3 AA deal 1-10% of maximum mana as magic damage.
Hextech evolution: Every 3 minion kills grant +5 max mana, large monsters grant 1%, epic monsters and champions grant 3%.

R- Hextech overload: (CD: 120/100/80)

Channel for 2 seconds while spending 50% of your current mana/sec to deal as damage, if 100% mana is used, you are shielded for 75% mana.

334,Toxicity and player happiness - Riot keeps treating the symptoms instead of the disease itself,"A few years back ex-Rioter Lyte started tackling player behaviour and went to great lengths to stop the toxic community from continuing the trend of toxicity. While I may not agree with the man (in fact, I consider him the worst thing to ever happen to this game), I have to say that the man had his plate full and I don't envy him. MOBA communities are always the most toxic playerbase and I doubt it any other game genre will overthrow it, it's just the nature of this very competitive genre.

What Riot and all the others fail to extrapolate from the vast data they have is when _exactly_ did the rise of toxicity happen? Season 3 is the answer. What happened in season 3? Removal of the ELO system and the introduction of divisions and tiers. 

For those of you that don't know/didn't play the game back then, League solo queue was based on an ELO system. You had a number and it represented your rating. If you got it above a certain threshold(IIRC 1750 was Platinum?) you advanced to the next tier. That's it. In season 3, Riot, for whatever reason, decided that the old system didn't work(it worked, I don't remember a single soul saying a word against it) and decided to implement the exact same system but with tiers&amp;divisions, except in the new system when you got to a breakpoint that divided you between let's say gold and platinum you'd have considerable, tangible challenge ahead of you to advance to a new tier/division as opposed where in the old system you'd just win your game and be done with it.

The ""new"" system (new under quotation marks because it's same old ELO just masked behind tiers and divisions) added a huge HUGE timesink and added the main reason of toxicity in this game - promo games. You all know how promo games work, you've all had to play those dreadful 5 games between divisions when you wanted to advance from f.ex. bronze to silver. In the old system you'd have to win one game, no strings attached. If you lost that game it didn't matter, you could requeue and maybe even advance if the enemy team was high enough ELO. In the new system, you finally get to the threshold, you have to win 3 games to advance. Even if you win those 3 games and advance to the next division, you'd have spent up to 2 hours of your time compared to a winning single game before.

To make a comparison - old system was a straight road, new system(today's ranked system) is the old system but with bumps on the road every 5 meters of the way.

I clearly remember game becoming INSANELY toxic around S3 adding that system. Promo games have added so much stress to this game that it's no wonder that toxicity shot up the moment they appeared. And why did they appear? Because Riot wanted to add another ""sense of accomplishment"" which is to this day one of their worst decisions they have made in this game. ",leagueoflegends

 About Shadow Dash(E): It should cause damage to the minions, but without taunting minions. 
 About Shen's Ultimate: Turned an all or nothing when using the ultimate to protect someone in the bot lane, because if you do not take the enemy bot tower is practically self-sabotaging ... because of that and all other tops laners have ultimate that can be used for their own benefit in the lane phase(Except Galio), I think Shen should have the ability to use the ultimate on himself and without channeling to use ultimate on himself.

But there is one big problem... sorcceres, luden's, deathcap, zhonya. Those items are essential in universal builds. I understand that we need strong and fundamental item's, but we can't forget about niche situations or oryginal synergies with skillsets.   


When I'm playing for example Swain and i want to build something boosting my tankiness, cause we're lacking frontalners then i'm kinda forced to buy item designed for tanks(like Spirit Visage), or when i'm playing Anivia and i feel that i need CDR to use my wall or stun more often... but then i realize that every Mage have 40% cdr and a lot of AP with common builds.   
Of course there is few great synergies like Rylai+Liandry for Malzahar, Brand and Singed. Of course i don't have any suggestions of items, but we need just 4 items created with distinction of the mage subclasses in our minds, something rewarding poke, something rewarding being frontlaner, something rewarding cc-ing enemies and something helping nuking enemies.

But my point is that there is no  niche items in game(at least very few). Actually reworked Wit's End is just another big item which invovles the risk of being abused by certain champs creating another ""great build for every Jax, Yi, Irelia, etc."". Old Wit's End was cool item, some On-Hit champs could rush it and stand a lane against strong ap(like Irelia in middle or Kog'Maw against Vlad+Brand on bot).   
What about Ohmwrecker? The idea of this item is cool but he is just trashy and uninteresting. What about Banner of Command? I used to love this item, but then Riot reworked it into gamebreaker and then they deleted it. Do you remember Stark's Fervor? This item was giving you 20% as and aura giving next 20% as, 20% lifesteal, hp regen for allies and 20 armor reduction for enemies. Maybe it's not balanced but i'd like idea of living Jarvan's banner, mix of utility, sustain and offensive, it could be great in few scenarios. I have a feeling that items are actually choosen by their raw strenght instead of circumstances of the game.

  
Actually the only class which is building around are tanks. They are building their first item to adapt to the dmg source of lane opponent, and then they are calculating what's more valuable magic resists or armor. Of course they might lack few items too, also supports, junglers, assasins, on-hit adc's, hybrids, and crit adc's, etc., but i'd like to hear your opinions and suggestions about itemization(lacking items, categories of items) in League.",leagueoflegends

358,History &amp; Lore Skins,"Recently skins are cool and very original. Some of them are references to pop-culture, easter eggs, or funny/amazing ideas. Even some of them are creating alternate universes. But I have a feeling that Riot stopped creating skins referencing to our history.  


Examples of historical skins are: Jaximus, Winged Hussar Xin Zhao, Red Baron Corki, Sultan Gangplank, Minuteman Gangplank, etc. Imho there are plenty of options like: Highlander Garen, Winged Hussar Hecarim, Prussian Jaeger Graves, Ashigaru Yasuo, Mesopotamian Braum, etc. Those skins might be a cool way to honor players from whole globe, and also to make happy every historian playing league.  


Also we have in game few skins connected with lore of Runeterra. Examples are Young Ryze, Viscero Xin Zhao, Pre-Void Kassadin and Captain Gangplank. I'd love to see more skins like Living Sion, Young Rengar(before his fight with Kha'Zix), ""Blessed"" Maokai, Kinkou Zed, etc. I know that value of some of this skins should be around 520/750, but it could kinda boost interest of community into lore, which is constantly updated. Also lore geeks would adore them.

362,Remove bans again from ARAM,"Good day fellow summoners,

I think Riot should have implemented either mode specific balancing or ARAM bans. Not both at the same time. But while the bans get a lot of support on here, I think bans are not the right way to go. Some champions that were oppressive before the rebalancing might not be anymore, but people are still banning Ziggs and Xerath. Ziggs' Q has been nerfed by -30%, but people are still unwilling to allow him through because bans exist.

It shouldn't be that certain champions become unaccessible in ARAM, that's not what ARAM is about. Rebalancing allows the whole playing field to be on a roughly even power level, so that the players are responsible for their success or failure instead of the delta in champion power. 

These are my 2 cents on the issue, do what you want with it.",leagueoflegends
363,So why is Ninja Tabi still untouched?,"This bullshit item that does not even resemble its name just puts all AA junglers out of commission.

&amp;#x200B;

I just had a game as Kindred where I had a big lead (7/3/6 post game) and after the match I was wondering why the enemy Riven seemed to almost always tank away the damage I should be doing.  I saw she bought Ninja Tabi and it just eats 12% of my damage for the low cost of 1100 gold. I thought this overtuned item has been changed? I mean I thought when we are talking about itemization and thinking about what to build against the enemy comp itt should be a bit of a thought process going on but Ninja Tabi is almost a no-brainer to buy VS AA. And this is what I hate. This Riven just needed one item to 1v1 me on and on. I got away because Kindred but with this big off a lead I had she shouldn't be able to just 1v1 me this easily.

I know that Riven is essentially good VS Kindred but

**my general problem lies in that the decision to commit into Ninja Tabi is an easy one to make because the item costs so few gold for what it offers that you don't really need to think about it. Low risk, high reward.**

edit: I get it the riven example was bad because riven counter Kindred in a way.

This was done in photoshop and is crap. I am learning Adobe Animate for this project!



I want Mordekaiser to be hesitant about this rework. Him being in a wheelchair, a shell of his former self, means ofcourse he needs this, but I want to capture the uncertainty most of us still feel in our huearts, especially the Morde mains community, as he dwells on Riot's past deeds against him.



As we go through the pros and cons of the previous rework, I want Morde to consider his past with Riot, and I want to pay homage to each aspect of Mordekaiser that we're convinced he will lose:


- [The easteregg bowtie] (https://imgur.com/YgXlPVE)

404,Is the statistic damage done to champions over praised?," 

&amp;#x200B;

Too often I see people praising damage done. The inting toplaner. The Lux support

It's usually poke champions too, like zyra and brand. And they completely devalue other champions/players simply cause of this stat.

Truth be told, it's easy to inflate damage done by laning phase and poke champions. Just now I saw people say in the SB vs DWG match how Karma had most damage done while being behind all game. Like it was some underdog to the top achievement. But honestly, it's not hard at all to top dmg charts as AP karma in lane.

Of course, wave management, objective taking, counter jungling and ganking are all hidding from shallow waters. Even high elo streamers, always after game ends they check their damage done. As if that's a consolidation after a defeat. ""I did good"". But did you? Let's say League was about kills and death match. Even then, it's a TOTAL damage done, through out the whole game. So you could inflate it while poking in lane, but then be totally useless when it matters (getting caught out, or not being usefull during big team fights near objectives).

I guess it's a bit like praising adc's when the supports do all the work. Don't think it will ever die out. We all love our 1v1's too, even though it's a 5v5 game. Just food for thought",leagueoflegends

431,ARAM Changes,"I feel like the banning component introduced today is useless.  Why?  Because ARAM doesnt have a meta that evolves much.  Champion design such as poke, range, sustain, etc. determine the impact the champion has on ARAM more than balance changes designed for summoner's rift.  Because of this, riot made balance changes specifically for ARAM, buffing or nerfing overall damage on certain champions based on their winrates.  Even so, the ARAM meta is very static, and champions that the playerbase finds meta will be banned every single game.

Furthermore, people might say banning can help balance teams and tone down one sided games.  This is unfortunately not true.  The champion picks are random with only randomized rerolls.  So teams are also entirely based off of rng.  So with everything being so rng based, is the banning system really needed?

Those are my thoughts on the ARAM changes.  I personally find them unhealthy for the gamemode.  However, i could be missing some crucial points, so feel free to share your opinion.",leagueoflegends

I was so happy. I wanted to reach Plat 4 and I was so close... as I said in S8 I lost promo to Plat 4 two times.. idk whats happened but im pretty sure its not on me. My attitude didt change, I mean it changed because for example as an adc your outcome it really depends on your support.. there was a game where I was 0/0/6 , and the game was 3-31.. I didnt die a single time.. that was my promo.. since like 2 weeks, I dont really play LeAgue dailiy, or If I do, just 1 game a day?!

Vladmirs wet dream

448,Why did we not want Irelia in mid lane again?,"I'm only asking because I love the champion but I really, really don't like playing top lane. It's so removed from most of the action in the game (it feels like an island for the first 20 minutes) and the enemy jungler can just decide who wins the top lane matchup if they want to. What I loved about Irelia mid was that, as a Yasuo main, I had another champion that had basically the same play style so I could enjoy and feel like I was on a comfort pick every game, rather than only on the games when I get Yasuo. What was wrong with that? She stopped being cancer mid lane as soon as her e was shortened, and she much more belongs there since mid-lane is all about plays and outplays, whereas top lane is all stat checks. I have to imagine it's terrible playing against Irelia top lane with a stat check champion, as she has so many tools to use against you and you just have to guess at whether you're going to be able to do enough damage before she uses them.

454,The best top lane experience ive ever had.,"I played against a mundo who did not play or do so well, It was okay at first but here we are at 30 minutes being dove under every single tower we got left being 1 shot and obliterated by the enemy team, I only ask why god as my limbs are ripped apart. The little Mundo had tanked 10 tower shots 2 ignites and executioners culling. All so his team could keep wiping us under turret in base. This continued until 40 minutes. This Mundo must have had a pretty good score you might say. Well he ended the game 3/3/18. He left lane 3/3/1. At the end of the game he did the most damage in the game just a small margin nothing significant just 20k more than the 12-7 full build adc, But the best part of it all was the counter-play that riot games gave to me, i felt so powerful with my ignite and mortal reminder. To bad even with all the tools and a score of 7/3/13 with two more items than mundo i just got outplayed. Truly i was just completely outplayed in every way possible. The way mundo hit R was just too much for my feeble fingers. His impressive creep score of 113 cs at 30 minutes was just too much for my wood 4 brain. Truly i have been blessed. Touched by the god that is Dr.Mundo and the patch 9.7, let this be a warning or a message to the weak of spirit. Id rather ban mundo than irelia, akali, zed, sylias, and pyke.

I ban Darius personally because I play toplane, and Darius on the enemy team means you basically dont ever get to lane. But no matter what I play, Vayne always shits on my team. Even if she gets dumpstered in lane she will still have 2 items at 18-20 min. Bork + Guinsoos is 6300 gold. Triforce alone is almost 4000gold but even if a bruiser is really strong, there is just no way to reliably teamfight against her. The ult + constant Q spam has literally no counterplay other than picking malphite and hoping that shes braindead. It does not matter who you play since, shes dealing insane damage, peeling for herself with E and Bork Slow, kiting you while having insane movement speed gains from her passive and ult. Like its too much.

I dont care how fed a Cait, Jinx, Twitch or Draven is. When a 6 item Renekton jumps on you, in a teamfight when your support is dead, you should be dead. End of story. Vayne on the other hand, can dance around your entire team in stealth and have you standing there like an idiot unable to target her.

Riot, shes not on the threshhold of being overpowered and needing nerfs like you say she is, she is blatantly overpowered and needs to be nerfed. Enough with the slick playaround the issue. Just nerf her damage, or mobility. Its insane that shes been like this for so long.",leagueoflegends

ARAM was fine. They could’ve put this time into a new game mode or polish an existing one instead of adding unnecessary features to something that’s not really broken.

After 100 games of playing for each game

Rainbow siege: 18 gun skins (2 legendary, 6 rare, and 8 commons). 11 accessories.

Apex legends: 22 gun skins (mostly common however), 900+ crafting materials, 9 skins.

League of legends: 6500-8000 blue essence, 5 skins ( no rare or legendary skins) 

Overwatch (it’s been awhile since I’ve played but this is an estimate from last year): 15 loot boxes, 15+ skins, 10+ voice lines, 10+ accessories. 

Two of these are free games the other you can get for about 10-30 dollars depending if they’re on sale.

I get that riot is a free game, and at times can be hurting for cash but, after playing this game for almost 4 years I just wish it rewarded more loyal players who put a lot of time into it. For a small bit of time I’d spend 30-60 dollars every 3 months but I honestly got sick of it and now I’m honestly rarely motivated to play, granted not entirely because of their reward system. 

Anyways let me know your thoughts, and I’d appreciate if you weren’t toxic. The numbers for some of these games are conservative estimates because it’s been 2-3 months since I’ve played most of these games. Apex legends (a free game) would be the most accurate item estimate.",leagueoflegends

I know its Ironic to ask for change because you're tired of seeing change, but Its time to solve the problems with the Jungle.

The following questions need answers:

- When / Why do I gank?

- When / Why do I farm?

- How many jungle camps do I need to clear to hit level 6

- Should I be the same level as our mid laner or our support?

- Why does scuttle exist?

- Should I get the same Exp for lane minions as our mid laner? Should they get the same Exp for Jungle monsters as me?

- How gold reliant should I be on farming jungle?

- How penalizing should counter jungling be?

- Should champion kill exp be reduced?

- How far away from minions should I have to be in order to leech exp?



**Riot** These questions need to be answered in the form of gameplay changes. There should be a reason for me to invade the enemy, I should be penalized for fail ganks, I shouldn't have to be reliant on my laners to get gold and exp (scuttle).

Maybe even more so because the usual short lifespan of URF encouraged playing for stupid amounts of time and burn out on the game. I wouldn't mind if it became a permanent gamemode, LoL does have the playerbase for it and after so many years since it's original release it isn't very new anymore either way.

The balance changes were very well done and expanded the pool of viable champions by quite a lot. The only questionable balance changes were how extremely strong and game-determining Dragons were and that GP may have been slightly overbuffed as his damage became quite insane.

502,"I'd love some kind of SR ""Laning Mode""","When practising a Champion it would be great if you could pick a position (Mid / Top / Bot / Supp) and then be paired into a 1v1 or 2v2 (solo or duo) on Summoners Rift versus other players so you can practice the laning phase. 

You'd blind select a Lane Assignment and Champion and then go into queue. You would be allowed say 2 or 3 dodges per game so if a match-up came up you really didn't want you could skip it. Once paired with another player/s you'd have a few seconds to choose summoners and runes and to smack talk them a bit :) 

On loading into SR, only your chosen lane would have minions or towers. Jungle camps would be active except for the blue/red buffs and crabs (there also would be no Drakes or Rifty). There would be no other restrictions but if the game could detect that a player wasn't spending any time in proximity to minions (i.e. they were spending most time out of lane) then they would be defeated immediately to try and reduce griefing. 

You would spawn into the map straight at the outer towers with minions arriving 15-20 seconds later so games were quick to start. The game would end when a tower falls or when one player reached a certain gold lead (say 1,000 or 1,500). There might also be a max CS/gold that ends it too or a time limit (say 10-15 minutes).

I can't imagine this would require huge amounts of coding and it would be a quick, fun way to spam games with a champion and get used to how they play. ",leagueoflegends

517,"A complete list of all the bugs in League of Legends, sorted by importance, with explanations, reproduction information and examples","Hey guys! I’m the Mordekaiser bug catcher. I spent years practicing by honing my skills, analyzing the most seasoned and most *al dente* spaghetti that League has to offer, and now that Riot is about to take away from me the only thing I’m doing in life by reworking Mordekaiser, I spent months to finally achieve my true goal: listing all of the bugs in League of Legends. For each of them, I’ll develop on its impact on the game, explain how to reproduce it, and provide screenshots or videos of the bug. 

Let’s dive into it! 

---

**1) Kha’Zix**

Without a doubt the most impactful bug that can be found on League. It has on its own turned the tide of countless games, even all the way up to the competitive scene, and it’s appeared regularly ever since late 2012, six and a half years ago. 

People affected by this bug have reported numerous consequences. Instantaneous death, appearance of an enemy champion out of nowhere, flying insects on the screen, sudden urge to complain on Reddit about how there’s too much damage in the game right now… A certain top laner, rumored to be on the new Bread Roster, even mentioned that bug stopping his backdoor attempt. You get the idea, though – this bug can take many forms and is an unseen threat to plenty of players.

**Reproduction information**

Before anything else, let’s dive into the reproduction information of this bug. I have analyzed it to provide you with the exact steps on how to get it to happen in your game, and the result is shown [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhAIlLiWxnI&amp;feature=youtu.be). These steps have a 100% chance of making the bug appear. 


**History of the bug**

Now, here’s one interesting thing about this bug… It has been in the game ever since 2012, and Riot has tried to get rid of it many times, but it’s always found a way to come back in the game, evolving to overcome the squashes. Apparently, change is good for that bug. 

It took different forms over the years, but I am nigh certain that it was always the same bug. Here is how it manifested itself. 

- End of 2012: First appearances of the bug, and we could definitely taste the fear of many players as a bouncy boi would get pentakills by jumping everywhere and throwing spikes in the air. 

- Early 2013: After the initial appaearances, the bug took an odd form. Spaghetti and broccoli must have not gone well together, and we got some Korean reports of a Kha’Zix staying immobile under his turret while being killed by the enemy mid laner. 

- 2014: The jumping cannon launcher was gone, but the bug was back and more resilient than ever. Unseen more often than not, and the bug wouldn’t take that much of a hit while invisible. 

- The bug then disappeared for a long time, but reappeared in 2017, being able to go from one base to the other one without being seen once. Some claim that the reason why it went unnoticed for two years was because that was the duration of his stealth, close to rivaling that of Morgana’s binding. 

The terror caused by this bug during that year caused Riot to try and squash it one more time, but once again, it managed to come back into the game. It is currently not at its strongest point, but is sharpening its claws, in position for ambush.

What’s interesting with this bug is that different elos seem to know how to adapt to it differently. Just like how EU players from 2013 learned to play with server lag, how TSMA players learned to play with a chair as their support, and how NA players learned to ignore the pointless lanes that are the side lanes, low elo players learned how to handle that bug and how to turn its occurrences into advantages rather than disadvantages. 

Let’s look at the win rate in every elo. 

https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/282712857538330624/561342026399088640/unknown.png

As we can see, the higher the rank, the more damaging this bug gets, and this is consistent. This can mean two things: either the higher elo players know how to abuse the bug better, or the higher elo players are too stubborn to play around the bug and adapt to it. But since all Reddit users are challenger (and thus all challengers use Reddit, due to size limits), and since all r/leagueoflegends users are stubborn, it’d have to be the second option. 

Luckily for you, I have mustered all my bug knowledge and understanding of the game to provide you with some ways to reduce the impact of this bug, should you end up being affected. There are several methods. 

**a) Reduce the effectiveness of the bug.**

Reduce the effectiveness. Simple on paper, thankfully simple to execute as well. For those who don’t have it in mind, refer to [that](https://img.rankedboost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pokemon-Lets-Go-Type-Chart.jpg) table. Simply equip items that give you a favorable type – fire, fighting, flying, fairy, poison, ghost or steel. If you really struggle with the bug, don’t hesitate to pair up two of these types. 

**b) Use the tools provided by Riot Games™ to minimize any problem that’s happening to you.**

If you’re a seasoned player, you should know that Riot Games always looks to make each of their characters fun to play as and against, and has thus always ensured that each situation offers its share of counterplay, as demonstrated by this [outstanding move](https://youtu.be/6h7O1YAkCxY?t=31).  

Here are a few strategies that you can adopt to neutralize the bug.  
**A)** Pink wards the damage done.  
**B)** Try using Cleanse.  
**C)** Slow it enough to reduce its movement speed by 5.  
**D)** Win the game.

Hopefully, one of these four strategies can help you reduce the damage caused by this bug.

**c) Prevent the bug from happening.**

That option is probably the trickiest, but outstanding modern problems require illegal moves beyond science. Here’s a video tutorial on how to do this (done in a custom game with tool assist since I’m not confident enough to pull that off in a real game yet): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0VOB624JAs

---

And that, was a list of all the bugs on League of Legends! I hope this can help the devs squashing them once and for all, and that I managed to give you enough tools to play around it. It would be about time something were done about it, since it’s been around for so many years. I understand that Riot hasn’t really been able to put that many resources onto it because of how much investment they’ve put on fixing Mordekaiser’s bugs, but Kha’Zix should definitely leap to a higher priority.

522,Drake Rework Suggestion.,"It's common knowledge that  the RNG involved with Drake is frustrating for Pros  and Casuals alike  specially mountain drake can change entire games upside down, I'm not going to complain about all the issues as everyone knows what the issues are but here are my Suggestions and hopefully you can put ur suggestions as well so few rioters can take/confirm already existing theories they have.

&amp;#x200B;

Rainbow drake: instead of 4 random drakes Combine all the elements into 1 drake but with reduced stats respectively. this will eliminate RNG and will reward every aspect of the game for those who go for it multiple times the first drake would be a negligible buff to everything but as they ramp up your power in all categorise grow. You can also skip a drake or two sacrificing late game power to get something immediately so it doesn't ruin strategy you dont need to go for every single one if its tuned properly

&amp;#x200B;

2nd Suggestion is to add a 5th Drake the Gold drake. 

Gold drake existed in the early years while i understand why it was removed having insane battle stats like infernal or mountain is no different.

&amp;#x200B;

3rd Suggestion Rainbow Drake added into the mixer but this will cause more RNG but if you have multiple good ones it might balance out, So you would have it included with the other drakes and like the first suggestion it would have abit of everything.",leagueoflegends
523,GamersOrigin vs Misfits Premier - Post Match Discussion (LFL),"Didn't see it anywhere, but it's still a ""semi-final"" of the LFL, which is probably the second most or most competitive league in Europe so here it is :

GamersOrigin 1 - 3 Misfits Premier

&amp;#x200B;

Misfits Premier qualify for EU Masters 2019 and face Team LDLC in the final of LFL Spring. They previously defeated Vitality Bee and ROG School to get here.

The GamersOrigin roster was composed of SmittyJ (ex-H2K), Pride (ex-Roccat), SozPurefect (ex-TCL), Tonerre (Low-cost Perkz) and Hustlin (ex-Giants/NIP), so Misfits Premier have all their chances against the apparently untouchable roster of LDLC. The final (tomorrow 7PM) will be quite a match.

524,Single Buff to fix Amumu,"Hello I would like to suggest a simple q buff that would allow Amumu better gameplay quality without changing his kit. I believe changing Amumu's Q ability (bandage toss) to have a CDR reset similar to Nautilus Q is huge. The current cd at level 1 is 16 seconds making his combo very hit or miss since it's your only engage to land your other abilities. By allowing CDR reduction of his Q for successful landing it his ability to escape through the jungle, peel, engage would all be enhanced and it would raise his skill cap by requiring more skill shots to be landed. Obviously damage would have to be lowered to compensate but it would be a great update that would increase his skill cap once balance. ",leagueoflegends

528,IG Rakan and SSG Xayah should have special interactions.,"I think for starters it's really weird having a rakan skin without a matching xayah one. There should definitely be some special interactions to make up for this. They could have some voice lines about being happy they're back together after going their separate ways or something.

I'm thinking also a recall featuring both trophies, maybe they hit them together like a ""cheers"" when you bump drinks. It just makes sense, I think it would be way too awkward and underwhelming if ssg xayah and ig rakan just do a lame recall. Maybe it could be a placeholder recall for all different world xayah and rakan skins if we get more in the future.

536,LEC Playoff format is (potentially) seriously flawed.,"**TLDR; If the 3rd seed (winner of round 1 teams) is really weak, it is actually optimal to sandbag and lose the 1st/2nd seed match if it means you can see your opponent's strategies without revealing your own.**

Pretend for a moment that, instead of three strong teams in the LEC playoffs, you have two. For example, its G2, Origen, and a bunch of monkeys.

Here is how, lets say G2, can exploit this format.

G2 can hide all their special picks against Origen when they first meet, and just play as standard as possible. All they need to do is force Origen to show their cards, even if it means eventually losing the series. Now, when finals weekend comes, G2 can sweep the weak 3rd seed, roll up to the finals, and smash Origen because G2 have perfect preparation on Origen's pocket picks, while Origen know nothing about G2. And as G2 lifts the trophy, Origen can only wonder why they tried so hard when they first played G2.

**Why is this bad?** Because it encourages light sandbagging in a playoff game, even if it means you lose.

**How is this different than if Team Liquid sandbags against Flyquest to hide their strats before finals?** Because if Flyquest actually pushes TL to the brink, TL needs to try hard because they can't afford to lose. G2 *can* afford to lose to Origen if it means they get an information advantage.

**But Fnatic are real strong!** Luckily, or this might be an actual problem.",leagueoflegends

Today I have come before you not as your prince, but as a human being and a fellow Demacian, with a message that every person who cares for Demacia should hear.

Since the very beginning of our kingdom, we Demacians have been on a journey; a decades-long journey towards a better future, towards a strong and safe land of justice and values. The journey continues to this very day; we may have climbed the high cliff and found our land, formed our kingdom, but we have yet to secure a good and safe future for us all.

In today's journey, Demacia stands on the edge of the cliff we climbed, surrounded by enemies. It must proceed with great caution to not slip down the cliff as it fights its foes to become the safe and thriving kingdom we all wish it to be.

Recently, there have been many events that threaten the balance Demacia needs as it stands on the cliff's edge; from the prison break of Sylas, through the growing mage rebellion, to the firmer steps and actions that were taken in the effort of protecting us all from hostile magic.

Those events are potentially the most significant threat Demacia had ever faced. More than the swords of our enemies - we need to fear the swords of ourselves, and those events had bad consequences on us all.

We have lost the way.

Hollow definitions changed the way we treat and look at each other.

Fears and prejudice divided us.

In the name of Demacia and justice, we misjudged our own brothers and sisters and brought misery upon them.

Many people think that Demacia was built as a refuge from magic. Indeed, throughout Demacian history magic has been perceived as a destructive force, but that is a shallow explanation.

Demacia was built as a refuge from the destruction that people had caused. Those people may have wielded magic, but blaming magic for the damage done is like blaming a sword for the misdeeds of a raider.

People should not be persecuted for possessing powers, they should only be judged if they misuse them.

More than to be willing to judge by definitions, we need to be willing to use our conscience and be open-minded; while there is only one truth, there are many ways to approach it.

We must remember that we Demacians are all humans. We are all brothers and sisters, and we are all equal; whether we are skilled with spears or with spells. Our ancestors; mages and non-mages alike, have stood together and made the same sacrifice in their creation and protection of the Demacian dream.

Our very nature as Demacians cries out for brotherhood, it cries out for the goodness in us and the unity of us all - despite our differences. So before taking pride in being a good Demacian, first take actions in being a good human, for if we let minor differences take our values away, we are bound to fall down the high cliff we stand upon today along with our dreams and future, and the efforts and blood of our ancestors and families would go to waste.

There are those who thrive on our separation and despair. They are dangerous to Demacia, to the dream that our ancestors sacrificed themselves for, and to the chance that we will have for a better life - together.

You must not listen to them. Our only hope for the future is to be **TOGETHER**. Refuse the shallow definitions that you hear around you. Look into the hearts of your surrounding; they are your brothers and sisters, who will live next to you in peace and die next to you in war. Enough enemies await us outside our borders, and they don't care whether we use magic or not. If we allow separation within us we will lose before they would even siege our walls.

Each and every one of us - from youths to elders - shall then be careful in the actions that we take every day, for they directly define Demacia and the success of our journey.

I stand before you today to encourage you to despise extremism and embrace the middle ground.

A total answer is never a good one; our journey is in a complex situation, thus we need to choose a complex solution over a definite, single-sided one.

In the name of Demacia, in the name of all the good we have achieved and have yet to achieve, and in the name of all the misery of those who are dear to us, I call each and every one of you to stand united in our journey, to help regain our balance when we need it most.

Say **no** to separation; spread the unity of us all.

Say **no** to persecution; embrace fair trial.

Say **no** to blind judgment; spread true justice.

Say **no** to prejudice; embrace the common between us.

Say **no** to hatred; spread love and kindness.

Say **no** to ego and cheap tags; embrace your surroundings as they are.

We must all remember that our journey to Demacia is still not over. It is not the time to allow differences to get between us. We must unite and act from love to each other and to Demacia. We must abandon hate, violence, and thought that we are superior, or we become as bad as our enemies, and Demacia will be destroyed and scattered to a thousand pieces.

Our only way and hope to succeed is to stand together. Let’s keep our weapons for our enemies and embrace each other with our hearts against the darkness that surrounds us. That is the true strength of Demacia, the reason it was created, and the reason we can stand here today.

Demacia's name and future start now, they start with you.

Let the forces of our nation empower you. Stand united. Demacia counts on you - now more than ever.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

546,"[Idea] Allow us to ""pre-select"" the champ we want to hover in lobby before pick/ban phase","Sorry if this is incorrectly formatted or has been suggested before- first time post here.

&amp;#x200B;

With the very limited we have during champ select (not complaining), I think it would be useful to have already hovered the champ that you would like to or know you usually play. Could also do the same thing for bans, since I mostly only ban the same one or two champs.

&amp;#x200B;

Example:

I queue up as Jungle/Support preferred, with Jax as my preferred Jungle and Thresh as my preferred Support. And Vayne as my preferred ban (cause screw that broken champ amirite).

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously if those are picked or banned by the other team or whatever, then it goes away just like they do now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm lazy and afk a lot to do things while waiting for queue pop and picks, so thought this would be helpful. Hope you guys do as well, thanks for reading",leagueoflegends

549,Information about a set of skins in early brainstorming phase.,"**Overview**

These skins aren't yet in production, but they're a very supported idea by the skins department/team at Riot. They're meant to be a certain form of follow-up to K/DA, but only in terms of aesthetic. The whole idea behind them is to embrace the ""Champion X has too many skins"" meme. This is all I know:

 **Skins Thematic**

 The main idea behind them is to turn five female champions into supermodels that are dressed in highly fashionable clothes that resemble those from Gucci, Louis Vuitton etc. They're also meant to make said champions look wealthy and fit the K/DA universe which they're a part of. The champions that will most likely get these skins are:
-Lux
-Miss Fortune
-Morgana
-Riven 
-Vayne

**Ideas I've heard for each champion**
  
**Lux:**

-A long ponytail as a new hairstyle

-A high-low hem dress decorated with gems

-Prismatic/gemlike animations

**Miss Fortune:**

-An elegant suit with puffy shoulders

-Her guns as cash canons

-A wave of banknotes for her ult 

-Diamond rain

**Morgana:**

-Overall much warmer color palette

-High-waisted and wide-legged pants

-No specific idea for the wings yet

**Riven:**

-Straight mid-length hair

-Sequin dress with short black pants

**Vayne:**

-Short rose gold hair

-Similar colorful design in stealth to K/DA Akali

**Overall:**

-They'll all strike a pose at the end if their recalls for synchronisation.

-Like the K/DA skins, all will get prestige versions if the initial release is a success",leagueoflegends
551,Hot take?-LCS is boring?,"To me watching LCS is boring.  I'm a solo Q player and do not find enjoyment out of watching high skilled players playing the true 5v5 game.  I'd much rather watch pros streaming their solo Q games.  Is this weird?  Solo Q is my game, which feels so much different than LCS.  That coupled with the fact that so many roster changes happen over the years that It's hard for me to care about a certain team.  There are a few pros that I like to watch via  solo q stream, but they are all split between retired/current teams.

edit: It might also be worthy to note that team loyalty/competition is something that is foreign to me.  I do not watch or care about any type of sport.  

Not looking for anything from this post....I'm just wondering if I'm the only one who feels this way.

What I am not okay with is that every time a new champ pops up Riot immediately hits them with the nerf hammer. We just saw this with the recent Urgot nerfs. If Riven is allowed to be strong and untouched, let other champs have their day in the sun. If other strong top lane champs are allowed maybe Riven and Jax will feel less oppressive.

555,Tank items don't scale exponentially yet they are inefficient. thats why tanks suck.,"besides a few. thats why tanks have to have overloaded damage to be good. look at sejuani. that champion is practically a juggernaut now, her kit has more base damage than most juggernauts now


if you look at tank items from the lol page. you will see that most tank items sit at 70-80% gold efficiency. which means. they are shit. yes am being blunt here. but thats quite frankly the truth



4 years ago. here is what dead mans plate stats looked like

600 HP. 

50 ARMOR. 

2750 price.


Dead mans plate now

425 HP

60 armor.

2900


4 years ago. Sunfire was 2600 gold

50 armor

500 health

now. its 2750.

425hp

60 armor. not as big as the other item. but these items were already not that efficient.

this goes for all tank items. its plain and simple. either make Tank items better. or make the resistance to damage reduction formula work better. make tank items scale off other tank items instead of increasing damage. maybe?. sort of like how IE scales off other crit in an adc build.


It doesn't make any sense for IE to be 111% gold efficient without other crit and potentially more scaling . and a tank item that will be worth-less to your overall tankiness the more tank items you buy


psuedo tankiness is working way better than real tankiness anyway, hp and resistances are just target to deal more damage. from % hp damage and penetration to resistances. these stats not only come from items that aren't that efficient. don't scale well. but also lose value depending on what items you buy

its not bruisers top lane. many tanks have better matchups top than many bruisers. its just that the items are crap. they are trash. nobody wants to build a tank item over a damage item unless your going against assassin. it just doesn't work. 


tanks have been relegated to gargoyle stoneplate to feel tanky. because otherwise even a poppy with 4k hp and 200+ resistances will die in 3 seconds due to how many % damage amp comes from runes and you get hit by that 3-4 keystones+someone is cleaving your armor here and there. % hp damage here. true damage there. just doesn't work well


Just make tankiness scale better. make items more efficient. don't make sejuani do a million damage. like she doesn't need to kill people if she can survive and be desruptive and do some damage that others can follow up on",leagueoflegends

I personally rarely ff at 15 in normal or ranked because i know that in low elo (i'm silver), ANYTHING can happen and it doesn't really get decided till late game. However, if all lanes are feeding, i do ff. If one lane isn't i just try to get carried. It's not so bad to get carried. No one in my elo thinks this way though 'cuz most will ff at 15 if they're feeding, regardless of how everyone else is doing. The games that really ruffle my feathers are those where I'm carrying my feeding team while they grieve and yell to report me because I won't ff instantly.

Remember changing it in a way that completely broke the game for several patches and then removing it because you couldn't admit that the old version made more sense in every way? 

I feel something very similar happening with this wit's end change. It's not as if nobody is building the item, it's perfectly viable and usable in specific situations. On auto heavy champs on midlane, like irelia or yasuo, or on marskmen into ap burst mages with some magic penetration under their belt. With this change, you completely remove what's unique about the item, and in exchange, you're giving it pseudo lifesteal. How exciting. Another item that can be abused by a select, privileged group of champs, while massive itemization gaps still remain unfilled due to a lack of diverse options. 

It also completely and utterly fucks tanks over. I guess i shouldn't even be surprised at this point, considering the newest version of conqueror.",leagueoflegends

Now, I know that Overwatch has that and this would be a ripoff, yeah.. but eh, like people ain't doing that already  
  
Anyways, think of for example High Noon Lucian that could touch up his hat and say his already existing quote [""Miss""](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/7/71/LucianHighNoon029.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20181017071930) for females or just [""Howdy""](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/2/2b/LucianHighNoon107.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20181017072223) for males or something?  
  
Basic skins could work without sound or with it if they have proper quotes.

I could already see Mundo making a silly fast-paced waving animation like a child, while Fiddlesticks would stop waving mid-animation and Warwick could have his claws pop-out as the animation is ending and he starts grinning xD  
  
There could also be simple animations, usually with more.. serious characters - Darius, Swain, Camile, Pyke, Hecarim etc. Just nodding or briefly raising the hand to greet  
    
Out of all champions, I am just not sure how viable would this be for KhaZix and maybe Skarner.. as well as, should all champions have friendly /hello or could some end up with something similar as [RekSai taunt](https://youtu.be/tSBpIxbMcnM?t=18)?

For guys who doesnt know what it is, you simply download a demo from someone else game, (game when he gets reported by 2+ players) and then watching if the reports were right. At the end you can submit verdict when u can confirm that report was given right. 
Where u could participate from silver 2+(or even gold)

Here's the thing though. I've probably played around 120ish ranked games and my LP gains are the same as my losses. I gain about 17-19 per game and lose 17 per loss. I know that low LP gains can be caused by a low MMR. But I don't think it's under what my current rank should be. Is there any way I can increase my LP gains?

604,What riot has done for IG is unfair for the other world champions,"As a fan of League I have been loyal to this game since season3. I've pretty much enjoyed whatever this game offered to us and as a part of it, I've watched every world championship since then. Now to bring up the main point, we have to go through few policies that riot has mentioned. There is a lot but lets uncover one&lt;related to my post&gt;
1. There wouldn't be a separate xayah rakan skin

And we also have to keep in mind with the ward skin.

Well, riot has told us there wouldn't be a singular skin for this couple. That's one of the reasons that CoreJJ and Ruler picked it as a couple. However they just went off with their rules so sudden for this Rakan skin. It could be seen as a tedious problem but the main issue is that they also broke their word of 'no champ is allowed to be picked same time in a row as a dedication for the world champions'. Rakan was already finished with CoreJJ and I believe it wouldn't be too happy for him.
This matters a lot because Bang from SKT wanted so Ez much but was turned down because of the TPA skins. You could also call for Faker because he wasn't allowed his Ahri skin since Riot was going to release the Popstar skin for her. If they were to keep their words Riot should have turned down Baolan's request.

Now to the second point, I have to admit that the ig ward skin was well made but this is also very unfair. To think of it, Kkoma from skt wanted his ward skin back in 2014 but riot said no, telling him to win worlds 3times. Similarly Choi Woo-Beom didn't get one since he only won 2times as a coach. But,how can Wang Sicong get a skin, in his first win?? I know League is now a China owned company, and they're enjoying their first domination in 8 seasons but I believe they have to hold their horses and be, or at the very least try to be fair to all teams and countries.

605,League Client : Display runes,"Forgetting to set your runes in the champion select lobby is a death sentence in this current meta where runes do so so much.

As such, why on earth are your selected runes hidden inside a drop-down menu with only the active page's name displayed.

Why not use the wasted space on the bottom right of the client in champ select to display the rune icons for the current page, and allow you to set them accordingly.

It's really not great UI design to hide this important aspect of the game behind menus when you have plenty of space in the main UI to put it, especially since you have these neat little icons for everything already.",leagueoflegends

615,Watching LCK I just realized how flawed the LEC playoff system is,"LCK wants regular season to have an high impact, so their playoffs are gauntlet format where the last 2 seeds in playoffs play each other and the winner plays the upper team and so on.

The LEC system rewards regular season performance for only the top 2 teams, who can get straight to finals after 1 bo5 and even have a second chance if they lose the first bo5. The other 4 teams basically get nothing, other than 3rd seed gets to choose their opponent, which hardly matters because they have to play 2/3 teams below them anyway. Winning playoffs requires winning 4 bo5's for the 3-6 teams, which is equal to winning LCK playoffs from the wildcard match. I don't think this is fair.",leagueoflegends

620,"New Champion Reveal: Helmet Bro, the Void Knight","#Overview: 

Helmet Bro is a melee AP bruiser who uses the Void's own dark powers against them, relying on crippling silences and slowly wearing down his opponents, while shrugging off their own retaliation. Helmet Bro is a dogged warrior, unflinching in his resolve and implacable in his advance. The creatures of the Void will come to fear the name of Helmet Bro.

#Abilities:

**Passive - Void Blade:** Helmet Bro's basic attacks deal 5(Level)+(0.25AP) bonus magic damage.

**Q - Dodge Roll/Ashen Strike:** Helmet Bro nimbly rolls a short distance away. For three seconds afterword, Helmet Bro's next attack becomes Ashen Strike, allowing Helmet Bro to leap 600 units to an enemy's location, dealing additional magic damage and silencing them.

Bonus Magic Damage: 30 / 55 / 80 / 105 / 130 (+0.40 AP) Cooldown: 8 seconds

Silence duration: 2 seconds.

**W - Cloak of Shadows:** Helmet Bro raises his cloak, gaining a temporary spell shield that lasts two seconds. If Cloak of Shadows absorbs a spell, Helmet Bro releases the spell's energy, dealing the spell's damage type in an area around him (425 units). The spell does not copy the enemy spell's damage, only the damage type.

Damage: 75/95/115/135/155

Cooldown: 14 seconds.

**E - Void Blast: Passive:** Helmet Bro stores charges for each spell used by a nearby enemy champion in his helmet. His helmet can hold six charges, and charges deteriorate one at a time every three seconds.

Active: Helmet Bro releases a blast of Void energy in a thin line from his helmet, dealing magic damage and slowing the first enemy champion in the line. The spell does 10% bonus damage for each charge stored in the helmet before using Void Blast.

Magic Damage - 0 charges: 70/115/160/205/250 (+0.50 AP)

Magic Damage - 6 charges: 112/184/256/328/400 (+0.50 AP)

Cooldown: 16/14/12/10/8 seconds.

**R (Ultimate) - The Purge:** Helmet Bro draws his brother's sword, and stabs it into the ground. The blade releases its stored Void energy for six seconds, dealing magic damage and perpetuating a Silencing field around a small area (500 units). Enemies cannot cast spells while in the area, and Helmet Bro gains bonus magic resistance while standing in the Silencing field.

#Lore:

**February Nineteenth, Institute of War, Eastern Outskirts;**

My brother Valan and I, were contracted to guard the Institute's Eastern front. There were rumors of something approaching from there.

Void.

It was something from the void, according to the Summoners. Something that while dangerous, should pose little threat to two talented knights like Valan and I. We had our gear ready in an hour, and were hidden in the forest's edge before nightfall.

**February Twenty-First, Institute of War, Eastern Outskirts;**

Whatever it was, it came up on Valan in the night. We're trained warriors, dammit, how did he miss it?

That doesn't matter now. He's dead. Ashes. The only thing left of him was his sword and helmet, both crackling with a strange, violet energy.


Void magic.

Before I could even finish grieving the damned thing fired upon me with a beam of light; same thing that killed Valan, most likely. I managed to dodge it, barely. My cloak and sword were destroyed up to the hilt. I managed to run for a few meters before it caught up with me.

Gods, it was massive. Taller than the trees. Tentacles writhing, three smaller eyes crowned over one colossal retina, a dark slit that flattened as it was charging the blast to end my life.

Only, the blast never came. Summoners from the Institute had arrived, and barely managed to subdue the creature before it had killed me. They took it away with them, and brought me to the infirmary.

I never even got to bury Valan.

**February Twenty-Second, Institute of War, Infirmary;**

I'm fine, dammit, but they won't let me go back to the forest to bury Valan. They won't even let me leave this room they want me to stay for 'observation'.

They want me to stay so I won't kill them all.

I heard their plans, their whispers. They're letting that monster that THING live. The alien beast that killed my brother, took the only thing I cared about in this world from me, and they're letting it go. They're arranging a deal with it! It's going to stay at the Institute and compete in their accursed League, in exchange for knowledge! I'd heard that they dealt with monsters before, but this... This is sickening.

In a flash of dark light, something entered the infirmary, stunning the nurse sent to attend me. On instinct I rose to defend myself, but it was no threat.

It was salvation.

Kassadin, the League Champion, the Voidwalker, had come to me. He presented three things to me; Valan's sword and helmet, along with my own sword hilt, still crackling with that evil energy.

He spoke to me then. If you want revenge, take it. With that, he was gone.

I can never thank him enough.

Donning my equipment, I left the infirmary.

If they won't battle the darkness of the Void, then I will.

I'm not alone; Kassadin stands by my side, and Valan watches me from the afterlife.

Vel'Koz will pay. The Void will pay.

Valan Helmen is dead.

Marrak Helmen is dead.

The Helmet of my brother is all that remains.

627,Should you be concerned about account security?,"Hello. I am not an active LoL player. I can not remember my last game. It was perhaps over a year ago. However, today I received an email telling me my account had been banned due to use of a third party program.

Despite not playing recently, I had spent some money on the account and earned many champions. Returning to playing has still been an ongoing consideration. I consider the account an asset so to lose it through no fault of my own displeases me.

I submitted a ticket detailing this. After doing so I looked at a stat site and, sure enough, there were details of recent games I had not played.

My current thoughts are: yes, this is a bit annoying, however, should I lose my account it is not the end of the world to me (as an inactive player). If I were an active player, I would be very concerned. A few google searches shows me this is a regular occurrence for League of Legends. 

Does Riot have piss poor security? How safe is your account, really?

Edit: I have seen other posts and user comments are always the same - it must have been my fault somehow so it couldn't happen to them. I don't even play the game anymore.

I understand Riot loves to keep LCS games interesting enough and stuff but you're sacrificing the average League player's satisfaction for some more LCS viewers instead. And I'm sure turret strength is only one of the things that functions the same way.

I am not fond on exercise and eat more than the average person, as a result, I'm often tired or sleepy playing league. After meals, I noticed I'm irritable which makes me prone to tilt and  mistakes.

My peak Elo was after platinum 1, during preseason, one of my cats had gastric cancer and had to be put down. I barely ate for a brief period of time and managed to climb high enough to get an off stream game with pokimane.

My highest rank this season was platinum 2 52 LP, one explanation for getting the rank was because I did yard work for my neighbors that week. As a result, my body was in a better condition

712,Lets talk about what would be the best destination for Forg1ven.,"Forg1ven is a all time favorit of mine. His dominant laning and excelant team fighting was one of the reasons 2015 (his SK year) was one of the best years of League of legends for me. 

That being said I am a European fan and tho I will give my reasons the teams I have in mind where i think he could be best on, you can keep that in mind if you like. Now lets begin speculating. 

If we look only to the west I think Forig1ven should not join a NA team and I'll tell you why. Forg1ven cannot join TL, TSM, C9 or even 100t. Those teams have heavily invested in their adc's this year. And regardless I think Forg1ven will not enjoy the practice regime and team culture in NA. Forg1ven (suposedly) is a very die hard player that wan't for him and his team to be in 110%. House parties and Fortnite are probably gonna work on his nerfs. But if he is gonna join a LEC team which team can he join? I think there are a few contenders.

**1: Rogue:** I think Rogue needs Forg1ven and Forg1ven might need Rogue. Don't forget that Vander is still on the bench for that team and he both played with Forg1ven before and had a few outstanding games this split. Larssan (a talented masters mid laner) is also set to join Rogue this upcoming split and with Kikis in the jungle this team is starting to look very promissing indeed. It would be a great PR move by Rogue, sentering all the attention on their new lineup and Forg1ven is gonna be the star if they do. Rogue could go from last place to playoffs or even better if the stars aline for this team. And to go from Profit, Kikis, Sencux, HeaQ, Wadid to Profit, Kikis, Larssan, Forg1ven, Vander is gonna be super hype anyway you spin it.

**2: SK Gaming:** There is some history here, but in the last couple of weeks Crownshot had been hailed as the second best player in SK. Is it then likely he will be replaced? Maybe not, but replacing him for Forg1ven might be worth the risk. Forg1ven would have an amazing jungler and good support to work with. If both parties wanna take that chance is unknown, but there is potential here.

**3: Vitality (unlike):** It is unlikely to just happen, but frankly Vitality's bot side has let them down very often in playoffs and regular matches. Cabochard, Mowgli and Jizuke hav all performed up to or above expectations. And this team plays a style that requires lane dominance to work. What better way to sement that dominance then by adding Forg1ven to the mix. Forg1ven has played with mediocre supports before and he would have a team to religh on. Vitality needs Forg1ven and Forg1ven probably needs Vitality. But if both parties will reach out to one another is another question. 

**4: Origen (extremely unlike, but hella good):** Origen has a dream team. 5 very good players in each role. Partick is even shaping up to be a very strong adc, why then would you want to replace him with another adc and potentially ruin the synergy build up with these players. For one simple fact, this team is the wet dream team for Forg1ven. Mithy as his support, very strong solo laners, and a smart jungler. They have everything from the training regime, to the invrastructure, even a smart coach. Maybe this is wishfull thinking, but if any top team would take Forg1ven now, it would probably be Origen, unlikely as it might seem tho. ",leagueoflegends

714,PSA: New Wit's End Deals Less Damage Than Current Until About Level 13,"Basically new wit's end is a worse rush item unless you very much value the sustain. You will be dealing less damage until around level 13 making it a better 3rd item choice for on hit champions in niche situations. From there it deals MUCH more on-hit damage than before. 

This is because current wit's end STEALS MR So until new wit's end hit's it 60 damage breakpoint(level 13) it won't be dealing more damage than current. 

Current Wit's End Gives:

* 20 more MR when stacked for a total of 70

* Costs 500 gold less(this is big to consider)

* It STEALS MR meaning it also increases the damage of other AP champions on your team hitting the same target as you. 

The trade off is that the new Wit's End.

* Gives less stacked MR, but higher base making you harder to blind side/poke

* It gives sustain when below 50% hp. Also making it harder to poke you.

* It gives MUCH more single target on-hit damage and attack speed than before post level 13 in exchange for team benefits/synergy.

Basically don't build it first item. I know current wit's end isn't really built as a first item either, but with buffs to the item people may assume getting it earlier is better. It's not.

building it 3rd item on hit champions is likely best.

719,Why did we revert back to using NA time?,"Back in the days everything was based on NA time (PDT or whatever it's called) and everything started at the same time everywhere, except EU for example was 9 hours ahead with their days. As Riot and the region offices grew, it was changed so things can roll out independently on each regions, so each regions can get something at the same time during their days, which was great. But in the last couple of weeks/months, we reverted back to using NA time, everything rolls out at the same time everywhere. For example Your Shop is 1pm NA, 10pm EU.

It's irrelevant for something like Your Shop, but it's kinda unfair if for example a gamemode is only available for one weekend, because EU (and I assume Russia and Turkey as well) has less time to play. In NA you get home at 5 or 6pm (or maybe even earlier if you're in school) and the gamemode is already available, so you have a few hours on Friday to enjoy it + Saturday and Sunday of course. EU gets it late evening (9-10pm normally) so we have much less time during Friday. But wait, EU gets back that time at the end of the event, right? Sure. If it ends at 12am Monday, it will end at 9am in EU. Well guess what people are doing on Monday mornings... hint: not playing.

Technically we get the same amount of time, but thanks to time zones, we have a good couple less useful hours to play. If it was still Season 3, I would understand. If we never started using region times, I would understand. But we DID start using independent region times, which was convenient for everybody, but then Riot just decided to go back using NA time and this is not understandable. This is fucked.",leagueoflegends

721,Applying pressure as a Jungler - Pathing and Ganking Meta,"Recently I found myself doing well on junglers who can go for that fast level 3 (Red, Krugs, Scuttle) and gank a lane for an almost guaranted kill. I think it's what's happening even in high elo (Diamond+) most of the time.

People get that level 3, gank a lane and start vertical jungling.

In lower elo (Platinum and below) junglers usually go into their jungle after being spotted and don't tend to vertical jungle because they can't rely on their team mates to follow.

I think that the lower elo meta right now is to camp the lane you ganked first time (kill the laner 2-3 times) and try to get the objective on that side of the map and than start camping the other side of the map + get the objective there.

An example of this gameplay is my yesterday's video playing [**Kindred against Lee Sin (Click to Open in YT)**](https://youtu.be/QzAyk59vSu8)

731,A choice of greater confusion,"Hello fellow players,  


A few years a go, i lost my former LoL account, which made me buy IP and XP boosts to reach level 30 as fast as possible.

I saved all my IP to have enough to afford two runes pages: attack damage and magic damage. I reached level 30 in a few days since i played around a hundred games or more of the Blood Moon mode, which lasted 6 minutes and gave as much IP and XP as a real game. This fact caused me to reach level 30 with a very limited list of champions.   


With the not-so-recent revamp of runes and masteries, I now lost everything i had saved for using my IP boosts. Since the new way of acquiring ''blue essence'' is now lightly through games and much more through level ups, I recently questioned myself about the possibility of creating a new account.  


Let's think about it, if I am level 30, with practically no champions but the free-to-play ones, will it be significantly faster for me to acquire new champions if I begin at level 1, because i would benefit from the quicker level ups at earlier levels ?

now as jungler i don't have any problems with orn ofcourse, but as a laner i have. Now early it's okay, i know i can't kill him, so we mailny farm &amp; poke a bit, but the more the more the game progresses, the weaker i get against him.

Now with garen &amp; jax i mainly like to splitpush, it's working out really well this season but everytime i have to split against orn it's just impossible, the guy is so tanky but does so much damage at the same time it's insane, with gnar it's a bit easier but still he's so strong i don't get it.

737,Tanks as a class are in need of buffs.,"Pretty self explanatory title. I feel like a lot of non-tank players don't really notice this, because a tank can still feel very relevant even in todays meta if they get the right CC off at the right time. But for a tank player it is pretty frustrating to play in the current meta. Toplane is an absolute no-go, with the only viable tanks up there being Poppy and arguably Sion, and in the jungle you're pretty restricted in champion selection too, along with being outperformed by the vast majority of fighter and assassin junglers. This really only leaves support as the viable role for tank players, which is honestly a pretty boring role and not one that most tanks are even suited for. 

[This image](https://i.imgur.com/tKL4WJP.png) is two little tables I made of tank winrates. The first table uses every tank, juggernaut, and two specialists that I decided were too much like tanks to not include (Cho'Gath and Singed). The second table uses only champions that fit into Riot's own classification for tank, so it has a few notable absences like Mundo and Volibear. You can pretty clearly see that the majority of champions in the red (Sub 48% winrate) are actually tanks, while in the green there are far more bruisers and fighters. While not everyone might agree that a winrate below 48% is a sign of a champion being underpowered, I think that combined with the fairly low pickrates of most of these champions is a pretty big indicator in that direction.",leagueoflegends

741,Why kindred (in my opinion) is the worst champ right now,"Kindred is one of the weakest champions right now for multiple reasons, but I think it is primarily how she works and interacts with the meta. In order to really utilize Kindred's passive (aptly named mark of Kindred) you need to have a role that is mobile, ie. mid or jungle; that is not to say it cant be played top or bot but it doesn't utilize kindred to her utmost potential. 

&amp;#x200B;

Playing her jungle comes with a problem of having a somewhat slow beginning clear compared to most junlgers' (this picks up after first item) but already left somewhat behind. She has a somewhat decent dueling potential level 2, but after that is just left in the dust unless way ahead past the 7-8 min mark. So how is this a problem. mos games last up to 20, maybe 30 mins. Kindred if just even to her jungle mate is 9/10 outclassed until the \~25 mn mark (when you pick up your third item). Until then she is dead weight unless she picked up a couple lucky early kill. If she, god forbid, gets behind you are done. The enemy jungler decides to invade, you cant fight, lose farm unless you have a hard pushing top or mid that can help you. The jungle farm that you do get only goes so far (with the exp nerf a couple patches ago). Being behind your ganks are useless unless your lane mate does most of the fighting, and too many failed ganks just you more behind. So your stuck behind. Now what most junglers' do at this point is mitigate losses and hope to be carried. This is most Kindred games. You either hope to be carried or drag the game on as long as possible and reach end game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Playing her mid isn't the best either as if you really wanted to play a somewhat slippery marksman Ezreal, or heck even Vayne, fits the bill much better. They aren't even the best here, so why should you play someone worse.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude I would like to propose a solution to Kindred's problem, and that is to introduce a small root to her E. What I'm proposing is if you proc your e the enemy champ is rooted for like 1 sec, this will help with securing kills and getting away in deadly situations. ",leagueoflegends
742,The Yasuo Rehabilitation Clinic - Donate Now!,"* Are you the only person that can carry your garbage team?
* Are you growing out a ponytail and are considering buying a katana?
* Do you maintain that Yasuo can fill every role in the game?
* Do Yasuo nerfs feel like a personal attack on your character?
* Have you lost control of your life?

Thousands of League players suffer from the crippling effects of being a Yasuo main every year. This horrible affliction affects not only themselves, but the team mates around them. Being a Yasuo main can lead to irritability, nappy rash, and in the worst cases, even permabanning. It starts with a quick test in a custom to see what he’s like, but can quickly spiral into playing him as a “counter pick” and ultimately maining Yasuo, even when he isn’t OP. 

It can feel like you are the only decent player on the entire TR server and that your team is conspiring to ruin every ranked game you have. That Riot Games themselves is trying to keep you down.

But we’re here to help.

Here at the Yasuo Rehabilitation Clinic, our goal is to help you get your life back on track. Our team of volunteers will provide you with the support and guidance that you need to become Yasuo free. 

We offer services including:

* Champion banning workshops.
* All chat role play sessions.
* Mid game meditation classes.
* Blood pressure medication.

We provide life changing services to those who need them, but to continue we desperately need your support. For as little as $2, you can provide the means for a Yasuo main to stop feeding the enemy team and ultimately get good.

757,TIP: Leave your client logged out while patching for much better system performance!,"I ran some tests, and CPU usage is doubled and RAM usage goes from 45mb to 603mb average while LOGGED IN ON CLIENT WHEN ITS PATCHING. This is because the logged out client uses nearly no RAM compared to logged in because nothing is loaded, and the CPU usage is doubled because the logged in client also needs a passive CPU usage of its own, while a logged out client needs nearly nothing. Disk usage is unchanged whether logged in or out. 

I hope this can help a lot of you out if you don't want to use the client but just download the patch ASAP so you can play with minimal system performance. Sorry if this does not work for you, these are just tests I ran on my PC. Thanks!

768,Azael vs Drakos: One redditor's opinion on why EUphoria is better than the Dive (currently),"Hey Folks,

Just wanted to throw this out here since it's 2 in the morning (PST) and since I couldn't sleep, I figured I'd write this out. As my name and timezone would suggest, I am an NA fan, but I like consuming league content from both EU and NA. However, with the departure of Jatt from the Dive, the show has changed quite a bit and not for the best. It's clear that Azael and Kobe are trying to find their groove with a key voice leaving the group, but I wanted to offer some suggestions with EUphoria as an example because the EU league show, like the rest of the LEC, has been FIRE. 

Now, here's what I like about EUphoria. Drakos and Froskurinn are great at asking questions, getting the discussion to move forward, and getting the most OUT of their guests. Drakos in particular has experience hosting the show from the play in stages of MSI and worlds, and his host experience really comes out when you watch/listen to EUphoria. He gives his opinion, but also leaves room for others to fill up the space and doesn't really dominate the discussion.

What kills me about the Dive is that Azael is the opposite. To his credit, he is very knowledgeable about the game, but his presentation of these ideas are akin to stream of consciousness, where his points have points on top of them that it leaves no space for others to really talk about. 

Here are some examples pulled from this seasons episodes (Yes, Azael and Kobe acknowledged the interview format didn’t work, but my samples are a reflection on *how* Azael communicates in general):

[Here](https://youtu.be/iYgnVlk2STg?t=2333) Azael brings up a funny scrim anecdote, but then throws a lengthy question at WildTurtle. 

[This](https://youtu.be/3z8B1FTkZ0M?t=648) clip is Azael discussing imports, and his point is made clear early on that he's arguing korean imports have drawbacks, but it's drawn out longer than it needs to be. 

[Lastly](https://youtu.be/iYgnVlk2STg?t=2570) this clip just highlights a trend I've noticed in the Dive where Azael puts forth so much information, there's not much for anyone else to add so the discussion halts there. 

Obviously these are just minute samples from hour long episodes, but in general I've felt that the listening experience to the Dive has not been smooth, and I feel that Azael has room to grow as a host/facilitator of discussion. I've never had this thought cross my mind while listening to EUphoria, so perhaps getting that host training or entering the Dive with a more host mindset can help improve the show. 

With all this being said, I want to make this first disclaimer clear that I do NOT want people to take this as time to flame Azael. I think he's a great color caster, but when it comes to the Dive specifically, I feel that he has areas he can improve on, and I wanted to bring up Drakos as just one counter example. 

Secondly, it's important to note that the Dive and EUphoria are different shows in nature. The Dive is a discussion with the same set of people focusing on the LCS, meta changes and other broader topics. EUphoria on the other hand is more of a radio/interview show that tailors their episodes to the new guests they have every week, so we get more team specific insight. The Dive tried this show format earlier this year, but it wasn't well received due in part to the issues I've brought up. 

Still, the fact that these two shows in their present form are fundamentally different is important to keep in mind in the sense that Azael can't just be a carbon copy of Drakos, but there are things he can learn to make the Dive a smoother show. Azael, if you do end up reading this, I wish you nothing but the best, and I hope this criticism helps future episodes. 

Edit: Just to be clear, my post is about Azael’s style of communication and his tendency to present so much information that it doesn’t lend itself to further discussion. I am *not* suggesting the Dive should be more like EUphoria or that they go back to the interview style.

776,"7 hours from the time this is posted, CK playoffs kick off. The winner will join KT, Jin Air and ES Sharks in LCK relegation tournament. A preview of what to expect.","Hey all. I imagine most of you don't watch Challengers Korea (CK), the Korean secondary league. This year has been a rather interesting one, as several familiar names have made a career comeback and last year's relegated teams entirely rebuilt their rosters. Below is a summary of the league format, the top five teams this split and what to expect out of the upcoming promotion tournament.

&amp;#x200B;

**Format**

Before anything, I have to explain the way the league is actually structured and how the teams get promoted. There's eight teams competing in a double round robin, 10 Week split. Every match is a Bo3. The first placed team at the end of the split gets to skip playoffs and automatically qualifies for the promotion tournament. Teams 2-5 get to face off in a single elimination bracket with Bo5 series play, similar to LCS semi-finals. The winner will join the promotion tournament. Now for the teams.

**ES Sharks**

Spring's number one team has been in CK since 2018. After being denied a chance to go to promotions in both Spring and Summer, ES Sharks entirely rebuilt their roster coming into 2019. You may remember this team getting beat by fellow CK team BBQ Olivers in Kespa Cup. However, before the split kicked off, midlane and support were replaced by LCK  veterans Kuzan and GuGer. Kuzan has been the best midlaner and arguably the best player of the Spring Split, leading in MVP standings for most of the split and dismantling most of the inexperienced midlaners coming in this split. Toplaner Jisu has also been very dominant in his role and is the front runner for best toplaner. ES Sharks kicked off the season very dominantly, going 4-0, before dropping their match against APK Prince 1-2 and almost losing against middling team Brion Blade 2-1 as well. After this, ES Sharks would go on to win most matches (while dropping some games along the way), until managing to beat rivals APK Prince 2-1 in Week 10. This secured first place overall with an overall record of of 21-10.

**APK Prince**

APK are the Korean equivalent of that Cloud 9 Challenger team that was four veterans plus Contractz. Except it's five LCK veterans making a comeback and renewing their careers. Errsu (formerly Ikksu), KaKAO, Mickey, Fury and Secret are all seasoned LCK veterans, some of whom have spent time over seas. Unlike ES Sharks, APK started off shaky, going 3-5 in the first two weeks, even dropping their match against the struggling BBQ Olivers. After this, they would go on to beat ES Sharks and start on a 2-0 rampage against most teams in the league before finally dropping a single game to Brion Blade in Week 9. They would conclude the split with a close 1-2 loss to ES Sharks, with an overall record of 24-8. They were overall the most dominant team in the league, but did not clinch first place because their match score was lower than that of the ES Sharks. They will face BBQ Olivers in the first round of playoffs.

**VSG**

This is probably the one team I know the least about, as I missed most of their matches. This is one of the rosters that frequently subs players in and out during matches. Notably, the roster includes two maligned players in SoaR and Mightybear, both LCK Veterans. Midlaners reM and Ruby are rookies, while the botlane of Veritas and Minit have some experience in various teams, with Veritas having spent some time on Unicorns of Love. From what I've seen, Ruby is a pretty decent mid, while Veritas and Minit occasionally pop-off in some games. VSG as a whole started off comfortably at 4-2, losing only to Brion, but beating APK. VSG are overall a shaky team looking at standings. Despite being third, they went 1-1 with all teams, only being able to 2-0 the two worst teams in the league. Notably, they either went 2-0 or 0-2 in all matches until Week 9 where they won both matches 2-1. They end the split with an 18-12 overall game score. They will face Brion in playoffs.

**Brion Blade**

Brion Blade is a team of rookies/challenger players with little in the way of recognizable names. If I had to pick out one standout name, it would be jungler Broccoli, who at one point was leading in several stats. Despite the lack of experience, they have found some form of consistency in going 1-1 with all the middling teams, beating the teams clearly worse than them, but never being able to best the top two. Brion had an uncertain start to the split, winning their first 3 matches with a 6-1 game score, but with one of the 2-0 victories coming from a forfeit match from BBQ. After this, Brion would be handed losses by APK and ES Sharks, but would continue with victories against bottom teams. This changed in the second round, as they would crucially lose rematches against BBQ and VSG, netting them an overall 19-17 game score.

**BBQ Olivers**

Besides APK Prince, this is probably the most recognized team by Western fans, as BBQ were formerly an LCK team with an uncanny ability to take matches off top teams and having a great logo. This team received some attention in off-season, as they became the first Korean team to import  non-Koreans in jungler Malice and coach LS. They would also import an NA mid (yes, really) known as Deus. Despite being listed as a midlaner, Deus would mostly sub in for toplaner HeoKong. BBQ matches were always interesting because of their draft. Lack of Annie mid aside, Malice would frequently draw Evelynn and Karthus bans, enabling some pretty unique picks such as Kled jungle, Pantheon/Taliyah bot, Neeko ADC and even Mordekaiser support. However, BBQ struggled throughout the season. They kicked off the first two weeks with a 2-5 game score, managing to beat APK, but losing to ES Sharks and forfeiting a match to Brion Blade due to health problems for some players. Things continued downward until they manged to 2-0 VSG in Week 4. Seemingly in a reverse of fortune, despite beating top teams, BBQ would lose matches to the worst teams in the league. They would go 1-1 with all teams except ES Sharks, who beat them twice (but not without dropping a game in the rematch). They finish with an overall record of 17-18.

&amp;#x200B;

**Prediction**

Given the state of the bottom LCK teams, I am almost certain that Jin Air will be relegated and that APK Prince will be in LCK next split. When it comes to KT and ES Sharks, it's a tossup. Despite having BDD and Smeb, KT do not hold a definite advantage in the solo lanes as both players have struggled, especially Smeb who has recently been subbed out for Kingen. BDD has shown moments of brillance and is most often the reason KT win, but he will be facing the best midlaner in CK. Still, the experience of the players may pull through if the ES Sharks rookies prove to be a liability.

As for the actual CK Playoffs, if anyone can pull an upset, it's BBQ. They are 3-3 with APK coming into series and finished with a victory, while APK lost their last match. VSG will most certainly beat Brion and advance.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR**

Predicting a Jin Air relegation, an APK Promotion and a tossup for the last spot between KT and ES Sharks. BBQ has some potential to upset APK in playoffs, but they will probably lose and continue to grow for CK Summer.

780,"Ornn's rework failed hard in making him reasonable in soloQ relative to his pro play power. He sees some pro play but has 45,6% WR in soloQ.","Stats i use are from U.GG which some rioters have said to best reflect their internal data, but its not like Ornn is looking much better in other stats sites.

Ornn was way too team dependent before his rework which made it impossible to balance him for both soloQ and pro play. He was meta in pro while being completely unplayable in soloQ with 45% WR and his current situation is way too close to that.

The rework helped him in some ways like giving lategame damage which is a lot more valuable in soloQ but it also took a huge step backwards by putting more power to the items he gives allies for free. 

Taking power directly away from him and making him instead inflate ally stats was a huge mistake as the champion was already way too supportive. Ornn needs massive soloQ buffs that wont break him in pro play and its really hard to do when he has a mechanic that literally takes power from him and donates it to carries, a transfer that is more powerful with a coordinated team.

Tanks are inherently supportive and stronger in pro play and having one also directly lose power to give to others is just way too much. Ornn needs to be less useful to his team and stronger alone if he ever wishes to not be a troll pick in soloQ. Its not like he is some super mechanical champion that can be even remotely balanced with close to 45% winrate.",leagueoflegends

# NOTES

A) Though they are officially designated separate universes, the following universes contain references to one another, which implies that they take place in the same world.

* Pulsefire + Everything *(While not exactly the same universe, it must be stated that Pulsefire time travelers have access to all other universes, officially combining all LoL AUs into a single multiverse.)*
* Event Horizon + Odyssey *(Odyssey Kayn's Rhaast is a servant of the Dark Star.)*
* K/DA + Pentakill *(Evelynn claims to take inspiration from Karthus. DJ Sona exists here as well, despite also being a member of Pentakill. Multiple talents!)*
* Winter Wonder + Sugar Rush *(Dark Candy Fiddlesticks seems to exist in both. Possibly a mistake.)*
* Omen of the Dark + Eclipse *(Again, not the same world, but OotD is a storybook fable in the Eclipse universe.)*

Please note that easter eggs in splash arts and interactive voice lines do not necessarily imply a shared universe. Additionally, [it's been stated](https://twitter.com/notquitefrodo/status/1060597470277718016) that elements of the musical universe and Culinary Masters can bleed into other universes, hence why every universe seems to have a Pentakill poster, etc. Pulsefire Ezreal claims that the show Culinary Masters exists in over 50 universes.

B) I've chosen to omit a number of universes/sets due to the fact that they are extremely self-explanatory, or could hardly be called universes at all. (Example: Pool Party. It's a pool party. You get it.) I also opted not to include universes containing two or fewer skins, such as Thunder Lord. Additionally, a lack of official clarification has left the boundaries of some universes unclear, such as Lunar Revel and Bilgewater. To avoid speculation, I have omitted these as well. If you disagree with any of these omissions, I'd love to hear why.

C) While skins are officially listed by universe within the game client (you can find them under Collection &gt; Skins &gt; Set &gt; Universe), the page is in desperate need of love and has not incorporated newly released skins in some time. I did a lot of digging for this post, so please let me know if I missed anything, and I will update as necessary.

Hope you enjoy.

# FAQs

**Where are you getting this info?**

Official skin descriptions and other official texts, most of which I found in the client and on the wiki. I've also been informed by tweets and other public posts from Rioters. None of this is speculation on my part.

**Doesn't Sandstorm Ekko belong in Guardian of the Sands?**

Nope. Why they dumped Pyke in that universe but not Ekko is beyond me. They did my boy dirty. Please stop asking me this.

**Doesn't X skin belong in Y universe?**

Probably not, sorry. I can't respond to all of these individually but I encourage you to do your own research.

**Where are the rest of the Snowdown skins?**

The Snowdown universe comes in three sets: Snowdown, Snow Day, and Winter Wonder. I chose to include Winter Wonder and omit the other two because I felt that the latter fell under the ""self-explanatory"" category (see Note B). Winter Wonder actually has some interesting lore, whereas Snowdown and Snow Day... don't. Despite technically existing in the same universe, they're just Christmas skins. You get it.

825,How do you main something?,"Hello there, I'm beginning to get frustrated at my inconsistency in league of legends. I get bored of playing the same champ over and over, since I began, I focused on playing the hardest champions in League, lots of skillshots, lots of abilities, and so on.

I have lost many a game where a 1/8 nunu jg or support lux still builds full AP (the 0 stack Mejai strat) despite having more fed, more realiable damage dealers on the team. It's just one small tooltip that can remind people to itemize more efficiently if they want to win...

835,It might be interesting/nice to get some skins for the poor Scruttler crabs and all the different plants.,"I mean, they deserve some promotions after getting bullied hundreds of thousands of times every god damn day by us the summoners of the rift.

How many of you found the enemies invading your jg by slapping the sperms out of the Scryer's Bloom? How many of your ignited asses were saved by eating the fruits that you smashed out of the Honey fruit after a lux support QWERD your face from the bot-lane river bush. How many of you, have gain tremendous amount of advantage in gold, vision and experience by furiously beating our Rift Scuttler, the pacifist. 

This is why we can have a ""scuttler crab and plants upgrade system"". It refreshes monthly. They get better looking skins when people use them more in that week or month. 

Maybe near the end of every month, we can have a competition between servers on the skins we got for our crabs and plants. The end of every month would be Scuttle-and-Plants Appreciation Day.

838,Season 9 Ranked has really been a journey.,"We all know about positional ranked got implemented and removed. There was the whole issue with MMR's being too high and platinum/diamond players climbing to high masters.  
While fixing that, I was demoted to diamond 4 when they did the Diamond+ reset.  


Even further, I was demoted to platinum 1 from decay yesterday morning.  
Riot Support Tweet about the issue: [https://twitter.com/RiotSupport/status/1113542462817984512](https://twitter.com/RiotSupport/status/1113542462817984512)

I have **never played a game besides a blue hole game that had stupid interactions like this**. 

The same thing happens with Hecarims Knock back, you flash out the way before he even goes to where you were? You still take the damage. For a game all about ''Clarity'' this is not clear at all. This is bogus. No wonder people have such a gripe against Rengar his leap damage is unavoidable.

This has NOTHING to do with the balance of the champion, this is completely about how the leap damage still goes off despite moving out the way before he even lands.

844,Study on the correlation of rank and aggression/self-esteem of League of Legends players,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a high-school student currently doing a research paper on LoL rank and its correlation with aggression and self-image. Let's start off with why I'm even interested in this topic.

&amp;#x200B;

I have played games since I was ten years old. From humble beginnings playing Mario Bros. on the Gameboy Colour to now being an avid League player with 6 seasons of experience in my bag. You don't have to be here for that long to hear or see various speculations  regarding toxicity and its variance through the ranks. However, I never found any conclusive results. To try to get some answers I decided that I will do my final year psychology research paper on the correlation between League of Legends rank and aggression and self-esteem. In essence, I am just measuring your aggression, self-esteem and of course rank.

This questionnaire is completely anonymous and will take you less than 5 minutes, which means you can easily fill it out while waiting for a game. Every participant counts.

Here is the link:

 [**https://www.1ka.si/a/211812**](https://www.1ka.si/a/211812) 

&amp;#x200B;

All of the results will be posted, along with a summary of the paper in English.

Thank you for taking the time to answer the questions. Best of luck in your S9 games!

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to post them in the comments or shoot me a PM.

I remember that one patch in season 7 where Singed (after 12 hours of the patch) crept up to like 53.5% win rate and was IMMEDIATELY (within only 12 hours) hotfix nerfed. This means that logically Rito should hotfix buff Singed now, RIGHT???

861,Should Riot Sell Accounts to existing players to avoid the road from Hell?(1-30 climb),"Hey community. 

I happen to be a diamond player on NA server so I admit to knowing nothing. I just wanted to get your input on the game/account creation. I personally think that Riot could make a better way to level up accounts for players who already have an existing account. While I believe that it is important for new players to level up and actually ""learn"" the game. (objectives, dragon control, playing around teammates, etc...) I think that as a returning player and for most of us in the community leveling up new accounts is a horrendous experience. As I am not in the LPP program because I am not a big streamer, I think Riot could potentially make a better way for players to level up or obtain new accounts.  One of which would be to sell accounts that are level 25 or 30 for about 50-100 dollars. In order to do this, you already have to have an account that is already level 30, is not banned, and you would have to do some sort of check to via email or something to verify it. I think you should be able to pick which champions are on it within reason. Ie you cant pick 10 6300 blue essence champs. you could pick 3 6300, or like 5 4800 blue essence champions. I find myself often unable to play with my friends because they are low ranks, had I an alternate account I could play an off role that I am not the best at. I am aware of the aspect of smurfing and the idea of this and I completely understand the repercussions of why certain people would not want this. That is why I would implement that you could only create an account every (6 months or year). Personally, I think it should be around 50, because of the idea that RIOT is allowing you to buy an account as well as its 50$ essentially to just skip the cancerous hassle of playing 30 games with out flash or without a jungle. This is just a rough draft/idea that I had thought of after watching multiple streamers complain pre- LPP program that the level up for existing players is cancer. Let me know what you guys think about the pricing, the amount of champions, or whatever you guys think!

864,Huge ranked distribution changes in diamond+ after ranked reset.,"As you can tell from the source below, in February diamond+ was the top 2.82% of players which was still a huge change from last season being top 1.5% of players. But, since the ranked reset (which was supposed to fix ranked and bring it back to normal/get rid of the players that don't belong in diamond+), now as of march diamond+ includes top 4.1% of players. Diamond 4 alone had a jump from 1.6% of the population to 2.61% of the population in just 1 month. What is the reasoning behind diamond+ changing from top 1.5% to 2.82% and finally now top 4.1% of the player base. Getting to diamond used to be an achievement, but now it feels like riot really messed up ranked by adding so many plat players into diamond.

866,"The coach of the split has been announced, but I think there is a name sourly missing.","Youngbuck

He has transformed Fnatic from a one-trick-pony (in 2017) into a well rounded a versitile team. When a team makes a 180 like that so often does the team religh on a one dimensional strategy. When that gets figured out they are out of options. But that is not what Youngbuck opted to do. Fnatic is now a well rounded team. Their macro is some of the finest in Europe and their diversity in playstyle is almost second to non. I have seen a lot of teams fail where Fnatic stood a few weeks ago. Yet this is the first time I have truly seen a team go from 0 to 10 that quickly. With stellar progression every week. 

Guilhoto might have shaped Origen into a tittle contender, with solid macro to boot. But Youngbuck has repeatedly made champions out of every team he has worked with and he is the only western coach I have seen that has made huge turnarounds on every lineup he has worked with. 

I would end it here, but I also want to quickly praise him for his drafts against Vitality in the best of 5, and making his team swithch playstyles that quicly to fully counter their strengths. 

I like Yamatocannon and praise Duke for his work on Splyce, but I don't think any one of them deserved to be mentioned more then Youngbuck. Especially this year I think he deserves the coach of the split award more then anybody else.

887,Tool that optimises pick and ban strategies for pro teams,"Hey everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

For my honours project, I am researching on a decision support tool for the pick and ban stage of League of Legends. Currently, the final goal of this project is for professional teams to use this to make informed decisions during the pick and ban stage. The tool will be flexible and be adaptable to any team or player's current game strategy and playstyles. Sick of playing Vayne for 5 games in a row? No worries, just let the tool know and it'll adapt! Does the enemy have a God-tier support and a mediocre ADC? Let the tool know, and it will adjust the pick and ban suggestions, targeting the appropriate enemy players! 

&amp;#x200B;

I have chosen questions similar to above to ensure a flexible tool. However, I am not a professional, and so I do not know what is actually needed in a tool like this. As a result, it will benefit the research greatly if professional input is incorporated into the research and design of the tool at all stages. Thus, I am looking for any professional eSports team, coach or analyst that is interested in the tool and can assist in its development.

890,Hats off to Riot on shortening game time,"Last season's marksman changes and shorter game time made the role pretty miserable. Over a long period of time, my average rank went down almost a whole tier. I wanted to own up to it but even the challenger ladder was reflecting the changes heavily with players like TF Blade and QT. 

Yet, the changes reintroduced champs like Nocturne back in the game. A champ that could get major fed before but couldn't really end games due to waveclear and tank metas reigning supreme. I remember when many others thought Karthus would never see the light of day again since tons of new champs were having ways of avoiding his ult.

Waveclear is way less ridiculous yet still good. A ton of vision has been eliminated from the game to make it much more difficult to make the ""right"" call. Tanks lost a lot of ability to 1v1 bruisers but are still valuable for teamfight and and facechecking. At the same time, tons of assassins still have ways to pop the backline thanks to more damage, less gold on supports, and less vision. Teamfights are also way shorter and have way more key moments rather than just marksman going Rambo on the tanks for an eternity. Shorter teamfights make untargetable assassins much more viable in them as well. Also, the new PD has been a godsend for marksmen due to the uncoordinated nature of solo q. And now we just got Wit's End as well to stack.

It's wild what Riot have accomplished when last year, so many players were complaining about the game but admitted they had no idea how to fix it. No one liked the bounties (especially CS) at first. Yet you can hear more people owning up to giving a fat bounty to a late-game carry rather than complaining. We all wanted shorter games without it being absurdly snowbally and feeling so helpless. Now we have a pretty good amount of diversity in early and late game champs. It feels amazing to not play hour long, soul-taxing games. The game finally has reclaimed that special depth to it that everyone loves.",leagueoflegends
892,The best ADC ever debate,"Hi I usually hang around inven more often than here in reddit in terms of league community, but there is recently a debate that has been going on in inven about who the best player is for each position. debate on ADC position was the most popular of them. inven's most popular opinion was that Bang is the best ever over UZI. It might be because its a Korean community. which got myself wondering why the opinion is so different from here  and inven on who the best ADC is. I've searched up some posts that i could find on reddit about this matter and i have noticed more people would say Uzi is the best adc ever over bang. 

I did not watch every game of LPL and Uzi's career. I watched league for that span of years but did not really pay attention to him. but I can say i did watch alot of LCK games and worlds. I do realize League of legends is a team game, but If I remember correctly, uzi's team was almost always highly praised, and considered as one of the teams that could win it all. Again, i do not know the details of the team and exactly what situation that they were in that led them to shortcoming at the big stages since I did not pay attention to uzi all that much. But at the end of the day, what did he actually accomplish? this is a genuine question. I did little bit of research, and realized he had fantastic year in 2018. and other than that he had number of shortcomings in international and domestic tournaments. correct me if i am wrong here, He won 2 LPL titles, 1 MSI, and 2 2nd place in worlds. And in that 'fantastic' 2018 when they were heavy favorite to win the tourny, they fell short and was knocked out in quarterfinals. 

I see that alot of people say he has crazy mechanics, and positioning skills. And in 2018, i did think too that he was the best adc at the time after listening to various casters and reading some post on league communities. But after reading the debate at inven for few days, I ve reached to a conclusion that maybe he is not good enough to take his team to the top. people might say he had bad team or there was this circumstances, that circumstances. but hes been in the scene for what, 6,7years? and during those years he definitely had the team and the chance to reach the top and leave legacy. but he couldnt. The team's game plan also factors in Uzi's performance. his team relies on the performance of Uzi. they give him all the lanes, buy times and champs so that he has chance to carry the game. And this is because uzi is that good of a player. they believe that uzi can carry the game when fed. 

trophies arent the only thing that measures players when debating on who the best player is. definitely not!. But I do not think Bang has shown anything short from what Uzi have shown. I actually think he showed much more.(again correct me if I am wrong) He performed well in any stages, and in 2015,2016 I would say he carried more games than faker did. I believe that Bang had mechanics not falling from uzi, one of the best positioning ever, and did not die easily in important fights. 

&amp;#x200B;

besides bang, I even think Uzi can be compared to PraY. He has 1 2nd place in worlds, and has won 4 times in LCK, and 1 2nd place in MSI. I think the mechanics are slightly worse than uzi's but hey, he finds ways to win and have shown multiple times of how good he can be in multiple tournaments. I am not placing Pray over Uzi but just saying, 

&amp;#x200B;

wrapping things up, Uzi is a amazing player with top tier mechanics for very long time. I think he had the team and the talent to show up in the big stage but was not able to accomplish much. I believe Bang is the best ever to play the ADC position with the skillsets and the success he has shown. But hey this is just my thoughts. I wanted to share my thoughts to this community and see what other opinions i get. ",leagueoflegends

922,Champion play style that you miss before its rework / revamp," Hey guys,

As someone who has played since mid to late season one, I've had so many champions that I love forever changed.

Sure, a lot of them may not have been that popular, Galio etc. But I seriously loved them.

Not all of them received full on reworks where they're basically different champions (Galio, Sion etc).

Some just had tweaks to their spells that changed what you maxed and their playstyle etc. For example, old Fizz his Q was insane. Feels kinda bad (for me) to play him now, where the main meta is to max E etc.

My top 5 champs I miss how they were:

1. Twitch (iirc he had like 60second stealth from Q, was fucking awesome, they also couldn't see you without pink wards etc). Also for me his old voice and lines. His new ones seem kinda cringe. And the ult. Spray n Pray
2. Galio, his Q just felt amazing to hit, huge instant burst. Not the most popular champion but I played him mid/ top/ support with pretty good success, like 60% wr. Loved his old ult...
3. Eve, her old stealth and ult.
4. Old GP. Sure, the new GP is much more skill capped and probably rewarding I think. Many of the older champions were much simpler, but I just never really got into this whole barrel-business.
5. Old Nidalee. Yeah the 80% of your HP spears were a bit ridiculous and the heal was OP, but was so satisfying landing a max range Q. Also shoutout to AD nidalee bruiser.

927,Some ideas to improve the clubsystem,"Hey people,

&amp;#x200B;

i'm the owner of the K/DA ""Fanclub""-club on EUW (100 Members + 10+ on a waitinglist) and thought about some ways to have a better clubexpirience in League.

English is not my main language but i'm trying to make everything as clear as possible :)

&amp;#x200B;

1. A Textbox on the mainpage of the Club

Give us an option to leave a permanent text, for example a bunch of rules, discord invitelinks etc, on the mainpage of the club.

&amp;#x200B;

2. A Message of the day system

This is a feature for Owners/Officers only.  
Adding a textbox, for those who have access to it,wich sends automaticly a message to the clubchat once every 24 Hours.

This is a good way to announce internal events or giveaways.

&amp;#x200B;

3. More individual Ranks

There's no role except for the officer rank to assign, i wish we had an option to create individual roles to give people

only the ability to invite but not to kick. Ranks like Council, Captain, Manager etc.

&amp;#x200B;

4.Clubtiers, Tax, Clubquests &amp; Milestones

&amp;#x200B;

This is something i really really REALLY would like to have and is an idea to improve the play-together expirience.

Adding tiers to clubs with milestones leveleup up by sharing the gained expirience per game to the club.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me try to explain this a little bit more indepth :

&amp;#x200B;

Clubs are currently just a tag and a name, nothing else.

But how about adding a rank to clubs starting at Iron 1 to whatever with rewards at each tier-milestone.

You can level up by offering tax to your club or by doing daily clubquests.

&amp;#x200B;

Tax :

You, as an owner, can chose members to share 10% to 50% of their earned expirience (excluding first win of the day) to increase the clubs rank. 

&amp;#x200B;

Clubquests :

Can only be done with clubmembers in your party.

Each person can participate only at one quest per day.

There's a Questboard on the clubpage in the client, listing 3 daily tasks with clubexp and blue essences as rewards.

&amp;#x200B;

Tier rewards :

Each division could grant 5 additional members and each tier adds an additional daily quest per day.

&amp;#x200B;

   5. Add a function to search for clubs.

&amp;#x200B;

Give people the chance to find a community by looking for certain keywords/tags :(

Indeed, the long range of his uncounterable execution ult give him a bit too much decisive mechanic in my opinion.

What I would suggest is basically to make his ult a reverse hook. In the current state, he grabs the target to his belly and delete it. In my theory, **he would be the one rushing to the target.** 

Therefore , he would have to think twice, thrice or frice to reactivate his ult and delete a target. This would as well fit with the fear mechanism which is currently not really usefull (except for ULT+ flash in).

978,24 hour purchase limit sucks,"so i dropped $100 on rp prepaid cards (kinda dumb for a new player, but i couldn't resist the furry capsules uWu)

the store i bought the rp cards from only had $25 doller cards so i had to get 4 (i wanted to get the 10pack furry capsules and then use the rest on a couple legends coinciding with whatever cool skins i get)

turns out there is a limit, and when i went to go enter the 4th card i got told i need to wait 24 hours i have reached my purchase limit. figuring this might have been a bug with 9.7patch downtime coming up later that night. so after the patch went live i tried it again and received the same message. i tried support to see if they can wave the 24 hour period. turns out they cant. also what i learned from support is that every time you try and make a purchase in said 24 hour period, it will reset back to a whole 24 hours. so now i gotta wait till tomorrow (2 days after i had purchased $100 rp) to be able to use the rest of my rp so that i can use the skins that i got for dropping $100.

its a pretty petty problem, but its still frustrating. i have no clue why the purchase limit would be such a low number.  this has been an unpleasant experience, and i am not likely to ever buy rp again. ",leagueoflegends

But Riot doesn’t seem to plan to nerf any of these champions.

However, Morgana finally being viable in mid for 1 patch, they immediately nerf her. Same for champions like Sylas.

Why is there such favoritism in Riot? Is it all about selling skins? I know Riven Anni Draven are supper popular champions with a lot of skins to sell.

&amp;#x200B;

On 9.7, Instead of lowering/changing some numbers around and/or reverting the CD buff they gave vayne that broke her and give her a healthier buff, they've decided to instead buff tank items and runes to get tanks to be played more to give a reason for vayne to be as strong as she is. So now whenever someone brings up that [vayne's pickrate, banrate and winrate](https://u.gg/lol/champions/vayne/build/) [are too high](https://u.gg/lol/champions/vayne/build/?rank=diamond_plus), they can now just say ""well tanks are being played more so it only makes sense that she's this strong.""

*(Just to be clear, I'm happy that tank items were buffed. In fact, tanks have been a bit subpar* ***in solo queue*** *for quite some time now, and this should make them feel alot better. I just hope riot doesn't use this as a ""we don't need to do anything about vayne now that tanks are played more/back into the meta.""

I understand the game is frustrating but don't complain about champs that you actually need to think on, when you main a champ where the game plan is running into the enemy team with R on and mashing Q on the squishes until you or the enemy dies.  


Maybe its just Yi the champ that's annoying but feel cowman's reactions/complaints when he is playing something, IMO, so simple makes it worse.

995,a few suggestions for the practice mode,"the practice mode have been for a while and it does achieve its job of helping players practice mechanical stuff (mostly skill related) but it could be improved even further 

so the practice dummies are coded as champions but they stand still, they do absolutely nothing what if we could change their behavior? 

how about this: 

* **chase mode** make the dummy (or a bot) walk towards you and chase you endlessly (unless you make it stop), you can also change its movespeed, this will help ADC's to kite 

* **runaway mode** make the dummy runaway from you, this will help players test the limits of how far they can chase and understanding the basics of movespeed and the importance of base values 

* **dodge mode** bot uses advanced scripting to help players learn to land skillshots and understanding the basics of skillshots, it can also just be made to move a lot without a specific pattern or one that imitates players most common behaviors against skillshots 

* **fire mode** every 2 secs the dummy will throw an ezreal Q to the player, AA's from the player to the dummy can turn off or on the aggresion from the dummy or also with a button (it also toggles the AA switch), all 4 dummies can be on this mode just like in the other modes  for extra challenge and you can reduce the cooldown of the dummy Q's based of your cooldown reduction (from items) 

* **replace dummy with a champion** this will probably need more work and a warning that it will make the game restart but its worth it because some champions have an AI for them from vs IA games that can be used for them to use their abilities like blitzcrank's Q or malphite's ult 

the best part of this is that you can turn on or off all of these modes at the same time (having chase and runaway mode will make the dummy avoid you if you walk towards it or chase you if you run away from it) 

these are pretty basic commands, they can be binded to 1 - 0 numbers on the keyboard or the zxcv line so players can have control of the dummy at all times 

* **allow friends to spectate a player in the practice mode with no delay** think about the posibilities, a coach can see a player cs and figure out whats its wrong and how to fix it and with these new modes it can help players improve a lot with supervision, it can also help a coach to make its players watch him so he can show a specific mechanic 

* **allow players to stack runes instantly** this is so you can test runes like ravenous hunter and overgrowth (it will default to a reasonable amount) 

what do you think about it guys? practice mode has a lot of room to improve and we should help on improving it ",leagueoflegends

The old one felt so much cleaner to cast and the new one feels so much clunkier. Do y'all think this was a needed change? I know Wukong doesn't get much love, but this feels so unnecessary.",leagueoflegends
1018,When Did League of Legends Change?,"These are my thoughts on League from what I have seen.

I started back in season 2. I was instantly hooked after a few bot games. Wukong was the first champion I played and from there on, every other champion felt unique and fun. From levels 1-30, I only played bots, going from beginner to intermediate and honing my skills. Once I hit 30, it was time to start normals. The idea of playing against actual people was intimidating. Can't recall the role I played but it was back when you had to call your role. Over time, it became normals then into ranked. The elo system was new to me, especially for a first time competitive video game. Everything was new, fresh, and unique. I played with my room mates in college and we all had a great time. I was addicted for sure, but this was also compounded with depression and personal issues. None the less, I loved the game. 

From what I remember, there were the occasional trolls that would pick bad champs or feed. Most the time, this was only in normals. Season 2 ended with 2 friends and I getting trying to 10-0 the 3v3 placements to hit gold for the sweet Victorious Janna skin. We did 10-0 our last shot before the season ended, but ended silver. This drove me to try harder to be Gold for next season. Not sure when elo became mmr and the system changed, but I was okay with it. Most people weren't but after so many seasons, you just get used to it. Season 3 hit and of my group, only one friend and I remained playing duo bot lane. I played Draven back when his bleeding passive was so good you could be bad and just roll lane. I hit Gold season 3 and wanted to be better. Around season 3 or 4, I entered a school tournament and ended up taking 2nd place and love the atmosphere. I really wanted 1st of course, but the loss made me that much more excited to play. Eventually I met some other people that also played, and we started playing 5v5 normals and ranked. Again, this dropped down to only 3 then just myself. From season 3 to season 7 I was placed into Gold. Season 7 was when I noticed the change.

Around season 5/6 I met another person that played league and we began duo queue ranked. This started my shift from jungle/mid to support. I enjoyed support mostly because the synergy with my friend in the bot lane. We tried so hard to hit plat but always got stuck in Gold due to lack of time or being content in Gold for the end of season rewards. In my opinion, Ardent Censor meta was the most fun time in league of legends. Some say it made non-ardent supports useless while just snowballing the carry out of control. I agree, but games felt insanely different yet fun. I could play Nami, Sona, Janna, Lulu, or Soraka and just play differently because I knew lane phase was the most important part of the game. League changed a lot and so did I but Season 8 and 9 have been the most miserable experiences so far. I'm sure some of my time line is mixed up, but 8 years kinds of blends together. Now to the changes.

I remember people trying hard to win in Ranked. Of course there are toxic players and inters in every season, but 8 and 9 just feels like a coin flip no matter what you do. I tried so hard to not be a keyboard warrior. I would report everyone for inting; I never used to do these things because I genuinely felt like everyone actually wanted to play and get better. Season 8 was a mess. I finally hit Plat 5. After so many years, I did it. But not after struggling so hard in Gold 1. Every other day was a win streak into a loss streak. My friend and I would always say, ""well i'm in promos, ready to lose?"" because every promo game felt like an uphill battle. Top/jungle dies early, everyone else is okay, but they tilt so hard they just give up and feed. This eventually became every game. Every game was a 50/50 chance that it was once sided. The amount of close games was 1 in 20 and season 9 has been even worse. Games are unplayable because of language barriers and lack of motivation. Luckily cheating isn't as big an issue as say Apex. I remember Apex Legends release was so powerful that the views on Twitch were double Leagues. Now, Apex has cheating issues and people are less inclined to play. Eventually I turned to Apex, and have enjoyed it but I miss League. I can't uninstall, but I have no one that actually wants to play anymore. When did ranked become so one sided. Even in high elo, streamers have such one sided games that it's boring to watch. I am proud to climb from silver to plat and realize I am in the low elo, but I'd rather be low elo having fun rather than play a game and have 1 person not try making the game unplayable for their team. I have bad games and I understand that, but these aren't just bad games. People voice that they don't care anymore, but why lock yourself into 20 mins just to lose. I miss when people actually put their heart into it. I don't think I will be playing much league anymore. My duo would rather play Apex and I just want to enjoy the game again. Even ranked flex is unbearable. Every time I try to encourage people to try a bit better and we got this, they just say ""its just flex"". That mentality is so toxic that the game is just over. I'm sad and confused at what league has become and I just wanted to express my sadness at the state of the communities mentality. I probably won't be playing more than once a week or even once a month which is drastically different from every night. I always thought I could hit Diamond, but with games being one sided, its hard to get motivated to queue up solo or even duo. Thanks for reading, and for those still playing, enjoy.

For me personally IF I have to face an annoying champion on the opposing team I just put up with it and focus on dodging/out playing. I make due with what I have with an inconvenience.


However IF I get an amazing Champion I have the time of my @#!$ing life! I get super excited and have a blast playing ARAM.


I feel like Bans work in Normal Mode because you KNOW what Champion you are going to play and you KNOW you can ban that champion that annoys you. (Assuming your teammates don't want it)
However in ARAM it's random... By banning a great champ like Lux you MAY have gotten her... Or anyone on your team MAY have gotten her...


Another thing that bums me out more than anything is getting stuck with a useless champion without re-rolls.


This is my fear. - That more people will prefer to ban a Champion that would be annoying on the enemy team. Then play that champion themselves. Why ban Veigar when you can PLAY VEIGAR!!

This is terrible for me because the champions listed below will now have a much higher % of never playing again. (Keep it mind that there are a ton of very strong champions that can be played in ARAM and these are just short lists)

- Xerath
- Veigar
- Lux
- Zyra
- Ziggs
- Heim
- Brand
- Jhin
- Ashe
- Miss Fortune
Etc...


Now Champions that I personally feel aren't as good or not as fun to play will be more of a common trend 


- Talon
- Amumu
- Tryndamere 
- Garen 
- Aatrox 
Etc...


The problem is that it was super rare for me to get these amazingly fun/strong champions that now I will probably never get them and constantly be stuck with champions that bore me to death.


I do understand that with better champions banned the other champs will shine a little brighter but I still feel as if the game mode will never be as fun.


Long story short every ARAM I will ban Tryndamere and hope no one bans any fun champions... JUST IMAGINE! if everyone felt the way I did and banned 10 crappy champs. YOU GET A GOOD CHAMP YOU GET A GOOD CHAMP EVERYONE GETS A GOOD CHAMP!


If I knew that I could have gotten Ashe/Lux/Xerath but someone banned them I would be very upset

Hmm maybe they just out played you? It doesn’t always have to be because you are garbage or your team is garbage etc. Its always someone else’s fault. I usually mute everyone / toxic people but it doesn’t stop them from spam pinging me. They dont even have to be right, they just think they know better and flame you. I will also note that it is possible that if you play around 2:30, this is when people get out of school. That could be a factor, I don’t know just wanted to hear some opinions on the matter. My biggest beef is why can’t players just respect when someone else beats you? Instead it’s something that your teammate did or is doing.

1029,What’s going on with Warwick?,"  

Hi everyone - this is Rizer01, I’m a WW streamer/player who has been involved with this champion for about three seasons now. I wanted to open up some discussion about Warwick and honestly just make sure the champion isn’t forgotten. I am not parnellyx. However, I think he is a fantastic player and streamer and has created the best WW guide to date. Our subreddit has a list of ongoing bugs compiled so I’m not going to delve too deep into those at this time. 

My op.gg: [https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Rizer01](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Rizer01)

Warwick has been struggling in the jungle for some time now after being nerfed due to gaining traction in this subreddit (despite being a niche pick in high elo). Those initial nerfs were fine and took Warwick from a Tier 1 pick to \~ a Tier 3 pick. However, further nerfs to Tiamat (gold increase, base AD nerfed by 5) created an instance where Warwick couldn’t keep up in farm with meta jungler (who don’t require Tiamat to clear). He is currently sitting as a Tier 5 champion in the jungle (despite being designed for jungle play). I believe he deserves better (honestly would be happy with him being a tier 3 pick).

**WHERE HAS WARWICK BEEN FORGOTTEN/LEFT BEHIND**

***Warwick has literally been missing from the entire April fools event***. There was no Warwick skin released for the Cats vs Dogs event (REALLY?) and Riot missed including joke changes in the buff/nerf list for Warwick. Ultimately, the new Wits End is an additional insult to Warwick and Warwick players, as they changed an item perfectly suited to Warwick’s kit to one that has general appeal, but has lost its identity. *Warwick’s passive was literally lifted from the champion (WW deals mgc dmg on hit, has increased healing at low hp) and placed on an item.* The changes to wits end made it LESS VIABLE on Warwick due to the magic shred amplifying his healing capabilities and DMG output (Warwick’s Q and Ult deal mgc dmg).

Of course, those are more recent changes. Overall jungle changes (scuttle, exp nerfs) put WW behind other champions. Changes to Tiamat (gold increase and -5 AD) resulted in a compensation of 2 AD back in Warwick’s kit). Keep in mind, Tiamat is the most optimal item to clear the jungle with.

1030,This season/split had been the worst 3 months in league history.,"There are so many severe problems with the current ranked system and ladder it is astonishing to witness. 

My first problem, the main problem for most people is the horrid MMR system that has all but ruined this season. I see posts every day of people complaining about losing 25 and winning 13 points making it pointless to play. 

Ranked roles was a major fail and wasted a solid month and a half if you put any time on anything that wasn’t your highest rated role. 

Jungle is in such a horrible spot. I understand jungle farming last season was probably too strong due to experience but simply nerfing it by a fair margin has lessened the jungle experience severely, forcing mainly gank or objective control junglers in the meta. 

As someone who has played since season 3, I’ve seen my fair share of people complaining about stuff and that’s why it makes it hard to gauge whether this season is any different than the other ones but trust me, this season is as bad as it gets. I’m hoping for drastic changes to multiple aspects of the game to come the next split. ",leagueoflegends

As long as the Kennen doesn't commit there's no way for a melee top laner to effectively engage on him so there's no way to win the lane. It just ends up being a coinflip on who has the better teammates since there's no way to actually engage on him.

The lane is entirely up to Kennen to make a mistake, which usually has to be a pretty big one to capitalise on. Minor mistakes are very forgiving for him because of his E.

1044,Guesses on the nine Shonen (Academia) skins?,"This post is just a general discussion on what I, and others may guess at what the new Shonen inspired skins will be.

&amp;#x200B;

First we'll eliminate some options. **Zed** currently has a skin on the PBE, so he's out of the contenders list. We'll also eliminate the other Academy skins as we'll assume they're in the same universe, so; **Ekko, Vladimir, Darius, Ahri, Ryze and Fiora are out.**

&amp;#x200B;

We'll also eliminate every champion that has recently gotten a skin, we'll cut it off on Nov, 2018 as I believe champs can get two skins within a year, and five months seems pretty reasonable for a champion to get another skin. So that will also eliminate; **Ivern, Fizz, Corki, Rengar, Yorick, Sejuani, Vayne, Tahm Kench, Mundo, Yi, Soraka Brand, Anivia, Nunu, Fiora,** (Already eliminated) **Vi, Aatrox, Sivir, Pyke, Camille, Lissandra, Leona, Nami, Leblanc, Graves and Fiddlesticks.**

*\[I didn't add Renekton as I don't count Hextech skins as a confirmation that you won't get another skin\]*

&amp;#x200B;

From the video we saw a couple months ago we can guess there will be nine (9) skins in total.

* One (1) Teacher. (Probably an 1820 skin) Possibly **Jhin**?
* Two (2) First Year Students.
* Two (2) Second Year Students.

&amp;#x200B;

The four available archetypes listed are; Assassin, Engineer, Sorcerer and Battle.

With it being confirmed the new champion (which will probably be revealed in two weeks) will be getting one, we can remove a Sorcerer off the list. We can also remove an Engineer (could also be Battle, but we'll leave him as Engineer) as **Jayce** recently got leaked.

&amp;#x200B;

My current guesses as to which champions will be getting the skins are;

Teacher; **Jhin.**

Assassin; **Katarina &amp;** **~~Master Yi~~**. (**Talon** and **Akali** are also pretty good guesses.)

Engineer; **Jayce &amp; Orianna.**

Sorcerer; **Unreleased New Champion &amp; Lux.** (**Syndra &amp; Neeko** have pretty good chances too.)

Battle; **Yasuo &amp; Riven.** (This one is probably the most difficult to guess as there's so many options, but **Jax &amp; Garen** are also good choices.)

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any guesses, or reasons why you think a certain champion will be included, please let me know!

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- The nine (9) champions I think will be getting the Shonen skins are; **Jhin, Katarina,** **~~Yi~~**, **Jayce, Orianna, New Support, Lux, Yasuo** and **Riven.**",leagueoflegends
1045,How Much Does It Cost Riot to Make a Skin?," 

Or alternatively, how many instances of a skin does Riot need to sell to make back their money? This is not meant to be a slight on how skins are priced or the whole Prestige controversy. I'm genuinely curious. Between concept designing, modeling, creating effects, writing and voice-acting for higher tiers, and testing, how much does it cost Riot to make a skin?  
Starting with Epic, here's the price of each skin, by tier:

&amp;#x200B;

Epic (1350 RP): $9.78  
Legendary (1820 RP): $13.45 (or \~37.6% more than Epic)  
""Low"" Ultimate \[Gun Goddess Miss Fortune\] (2775 RP): $19.82 (or \~47.4% more than Legendary)  
""True"" Ultimate (3250 RP): $23.55 (or \~18.8% more than Low Ultimate)  
\*These values are derived using the minimum required RP purchases, as if the person buying the RP was only buying enough for one specific skin.

&amp;#x200B;

But of course, not all skins are made equal, even within the same tier. I think the K/DA skins had about 80 iterations or something like that. But given the success and popularity of the K/DA line, I have no doubt they made their money back and more. Then there's Elementalist Lux, a skin that demanded so much work that it made them say ""Never again."" Once again, though, since Lux is such a popular Champion, I don't think they had any issue getting their money back.

&amp;#x200B;

But the question remains: at what point, at least in general, do they start seeing a profit on a skin? 5,000? 10,000?  
Or maybe a lot sooner than that. Could it be as quickly as 1,000?  
Do some skins never make a profit and it's up to the success of other skins to make up for it?

1054,Noob question: Best way to be a casual player... forever?,"Hi all,

This is a bit of an odd post but I'm gonna give it a shot: basically, I enjoy playing \~2 hours (sometimes more, sometimes less) of League a day. I'm level 27 so still a noob, and as such there are a lot of champions/roles I enjoy playing but don't do well yet because I like to mix it up every few days rather than specialise. I'm a casual player and a noob: I'm not looking to be a pro, I'm not even looking to be vaguely competitive, I just like to play and have fun, maybe improve a bit from time to time. That said, although I might watch a 10min YouTube video here and there to improve my play, I'm not dedicated to improving significantly - I kind of figure I'll just slowly get better with time. As said, I just want to play the game! 

I've found as I increase in level, the culture is getting ruder, the blow-ups worse, and the criticism harsher. I like playing draft because everyone knows their role, I like the bans, not facing my own champion in the field, etc. however this is also the level at which things seem to be nastiest at my level (since I'm not high enough to play ranked yet). I hate playing vs bots because it's so boring, but that seems to be where everyone is the most chill.

**I guess I was just wondering if there's any way to either play at lower levels, stop myself from levelling up maybe (since I feel like I'm levelling faster than I'm improving), or if perhaps playing ranked would end up being good (once I hit level 30) since then my crappy ass will be paired with other noobs. Or is it just even nastier there?** 

Overall I've really lost my desire to play because of the nastiness and the pressure to be awesome at any champion I play: I feel like if I don't get better, I just won't be able to have fun any more, but I don't want to spend my time watching other people play, that's not fun for me and I've found every stream I've watched to be completely uneducational and unhelpful, because they assume everyone watching already knows what they're doing. YouTube videos are OK but usually too long and use too much lingo.   


&amp;#x200B;

\--------

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Casual player who likes being a casual player but hates being targeted for noobiness. Looking for a way to improve my experience so I can just improve naturally and have fun, rather than feeling like I'm never good enough. Ideally I would just stop levelling up so I could catch up to where everyone else at my level is. ",leagueoflegends

The hextech hunter

Lore: 

A forgotten zaunite, with his mind transferred to a mechanical body and awakened by the curiosity of a child prodigy, has vowed to rid runeterra of whoever turned him into what he is now, in his quest he hunts whoever has a piece of hextech on them in hopes that it leads them to his target.

Pasive: Enhanced hextech rifle

Your AAs deal 15 magic damage per 250 mana and that damage turns to true damage after reaching 3000 max mana but starts consuming half the damage as mana and stops scaling.

Q- Hextech charge: (CD:10/9/8/7/6)

Channel for up to 4 seconds to boost your next basic attack consuming 2% mana/sec and increasing your next AA's range by 200(100/sec) and damage by as much mana spent during channel.

W- Hextech defenses: (CD: 15)

Passive: when shielded, recover 50% of the shield as mana and its mana cost as life.
Active: Spend 15% of your current mana to shield yourself or an ally for half the amount of mana spent for 2 seconds, if the shield is broken +20% movement speed (+10 for every 100 mana spent for the cast)

E- Hextech bullets/Hextech evolution: (Passive)

Hextech bullets: Every 3 AA deal 1-10% of maximum mana as magic damage.
Hextech evolution: Every 3 minion kills grant +5 max mana, large monsters grant 1%, epic monsters and champions grant 3%.

R- Hextech overload: (CD: 120/100/80)

Channel for 2 seconds while spending 50% of your current mana/sec to deal as damage, if 100% mana is used, you are shielded for 75% mana.

What Riot and all the others fail to extrapolate from the vast data they have is when _exactly_ did the rise of toxicity happen? Season 3 is the answer. What happened in season 3? Removal of the ELO system and the introduction of divisions and tiers. 

For those of you that don't know/didn't play the game back then, League solo queue was based on an ELO system. You had a number and it represented your rating. If you got it above a certain threshold(IIRC 1750 was Platinum?) you advanced to the next tier. That's it. In season 3, Riot, for whatever reason, decided that the old system didn't work(it worked, I don't remember a single soul saying a word against it) and decided to implement the exact same system but with tiers&amp;divisions, except in the new system when you got to a breakpoint that divided you between let's say gold and platinum you'd have considerable, tangible challenge ahead of you to advance to a new tier/division as opposed where in the old system you'd just win your game and be done with it.

The ""new"" system (new under quotation marks because it's same old ELO just masked behind tiers and divisions) added a huge HUGE timesink and added the main reason of toxicity in this game - promo games. You all know how promo games work, you've all had to play those dreadful 5 games between divisions when you wanted to advance from f.ex. bronze to silver. In the old system you'd have to win one game, no strings attached. If you lost that game it didn't matter, you could requeue and maybe even advance if the enemy team was high enough ELO. In the new system, you finally get to the threshold, you have to win 3 games to advance. Even if you win those 3 games and advance to the next division, you'd have spent up to 2 hours of your time compared to a winning single game before.

To make a comparison - old system was a straight road, new system(today's ranked system) is the old system but with bumps on the road every 5 meters of the way.

I clearly remember game becoming INSANELY toxic around S3 adding that system. Promo games have added so much stress to this game that it's no wonder that toxicity shot up the moment they appeared. And why did they appear? Because Riot wanted to add another ""sense of accomplishment"" which is to this day one of their worst decisions they have made in this game. ",leagueoflegends

1080,Suggestions for changes in Shen's abilities,"Shen's Twilight Assault(Q) should look like Diana's third basic attack with passive, this will help clear wave and make shen more attractive. Remove spiritual sword, make the spirits refuge(w) always appear at his feet regardless of where the spiritual sword is, but removing the spiritual sword will require a good buff on the damage of the Twilight Assault (Q). 
 About Shadow Dash(E): It should cause damage to the minions, but without taunting minions. 
 About Shen's Ultimate: Turned an all or nothing when using the ultimate to protect someone in the bot lane, because if you do not take the enemy bot tower is practically self-sabotaging ... because of that and all other tops laners have ultimate that can be used for their own benefit in the lane phase(Except Galio), I think Shen should have the ability to use the ultimate on himself and without channeling to use ultimate on himself.

1084,There is a giant itemization gap in the game right now,"(At the begining i'd like to inform you that english isn't my native language so there is a risk of making grammar mistakes, etc.)

Well, I'm playing since 2011, and lately i have a feeling that every single itemization is almost identical. Of course there is a variety of classes like bruisers, tanks, mages, etc., but still, every game seems to be focused on few very essential items.  

Mages are the best example. In game we have few categories of mages:   


\- poking from large distance artillery mages like Xerath,   
\- kinda tought, frontlane battle mages like Swain or Sylas,   
\- zoning fights control mages like Anivia   
\- bursting/nuking AP assasin like LB,   
  
But there is one big problem... sorcceres, luden's, deathcap, zhonya. Those items are essential in universal builds. I understand that we need strong and fundamental item's, but we can't forget about niche situations or oryginal synergies with skillsets.   


When I'm playing for example Swain and i want to build something boosting my tankiness, cause we're lacking frontalners then i'm kinda forced to buy item designed for tanks(like Spirit Visage), or when i'm playing Anivia and i feel that i need CDR to use my wall or stun more often... but then i realize that every Mage have 40% cdr and a lot of AP with common builds.   
Of course there is few great synergies like Rylai+Liandry for Malzahar, Brand and Singed. Of course i don't have any suggestions of items, but we need just 4 items created with distinction of the mage subclasses in our minds, something rewarding poke, something rewarding being frontlaner, something rewarding cc-ing enemies and something helping nuking enemies.

But my point is that there is no  niche items in game(at least very few). Actually reworked Wit's End is just another big item which invovles the risk of being abused by certain champs creating another ""great build for every Jax, Yi, Irelia, etc."". Old Wit's End was cool item, some On-Hit champs could rush it and stand a lane against strong ap(like Irelia in middle or Kog'Maw against Vlad+Brand on bot).   
What about Ohmwrecker? The idea of this item is cool but he is just trashy and uninteresting. What about Banner of Command? I used to love this item, but then Riot reworked it into gamebreaker and then they deleted it. Do you remember Stark's Fervor? This item was giving you 20% as and aura giving next 20% as, 20% lifesteal, hp regen for allies and 20 armor reduction for enemies. Maybe it's not balanced but i'd like idea of living Jarvan's banner, mix of utility, sustain and offensive, it could be great in few scenarios. I have a feeling that items are actually choosen by their raw strenght instead of circumstances of the game.

  
Actually the only class which is building around are tanks. They are building their first item to adapt to the dmg source of lane opponent, and then they are calculating what's more valuable magic resists or armor. Of course they might lack few items too, also supports, junglers, assasins, on-hit adc's, hybrids, and crit adc's, etc., but i'd like to hear your opinions and suggestions about itemization(lacking items, categories of items) in League.",leagueoflegends

1102,History &amp; Lore Skins,"Recently skins are cool and very original. Some of them are references to pop-culture, easter eggs, or funny/amazing ideas. Even some of them are creating alternate universes. But I have a feeling that Riot stopped creating skins referencing to our history.  


Examples of historical skins are: Jaximus, Winged Hussar Xin Zhao, Red Baron Corki, Sultan Gangplank, Minuteman Gangplank, etc. Imho there are plenty of options like: Highlander Garen, Winged Hussar Hecarim, Prussian Jaeger Graves, Ashigaru Yasuo, Mesopotamian Braum, etc. Those skins might be a cool way to honor players from whole globe, and also to make happy every historian playing league.  


Also we have in game few skins connected with lore of Runeterra. Examples are Young Ryze, Viscero Xin Zhao, Pre-Void Kassadin and Captain Gangplank. I'd love to see more skins like Living Sion, Young Rengar(before his fight with Kha'Zix), ""Blessed"" Maokai, Kinkou Zed, etc. I know that value of some of this skins should be around 520/750, but it could kinda boost interest of community into lore, which is constantly updated. Also lore geeks would adore them.

1106,Remove bans again from ARAM,"Good day fellow summoners,

I think Riot should have implemented either mode specific balancing or ARAM bans. Not both at the same time. But while the bans get a lot of support on here, I think bans are not the right way to go. Some champions that were oppressive before the rebalancing might not be anymore, but people are still banning Ziggs and Xerath. Ziggs' Q has been nerfed by -30%, but people are still unwilling to allow him through because bans exist.

It shouldn't be that certain champions become unaccessible in ARAM, that's not what ARAM is about. Rebalancing allows the whole playing field to be on a roughly even power level, so that the players are responsible for their success or failure instead of the delta in champion power. 

These are my 2 cents on the issue, do what you want with it.",leagueoflegends
1107,So why is Ninja Tabi still untouched?,"This bullshit item that does not even resemble its name just puts all AA junglers out of commission.

&amp;#x200B;

I just had a game as Kindred where I had a big lead (7/3/6 post game) and after the match I was wondering why the enemy Riven seemed to almost always tank away the damage I should be doing.  I saw she bought Ninja Tabi and it just eats 12% of my damage for the low cost of 1100 gold. I thought this overtuned item has been changed? I mean I thought when we are talking about itemization and thinking about what to build against the enemy comp itt should be a bit of a thought process going on but Ninja Tabi is almost a no-brainer to buy VS AA. And this is what I hate. This Riven just needed one item to 1v1 me on and on. I got away because Kindred but with this big off a lead I had she shouldn't be able to just 1v1 me this easily.

I know that Riven is essentially good VS Kindred but

**my general problem lies in that the decision to commit into Ninja Tabi is an easy one to make because the item costs so few gold for what it offers that you don't really need to think about it. Low risk, high reward.**

As we go through the pros and cons of the previous rework, I want Morde to consider his past with Riot, and I want to pay homage to each aspect of Mordekaiser that we're convinced he will lose:

1148,Is the statistic damage done to champions over praised?," 

&amp;#x200B;

Too often I see people praising damage done. The inting toplaner. The Lux support

It's usually poke champions too, like zyra and brand. And they completely devalue other champions/players simply cause of this stat.

Truth be told, it's easy to inflate damage done by laning phase and poke champions. Just now I saw people say in the SB vs DWG match how Karma had most damage done while being behind all game. Like it was some underdog to the top achievement. But honestly, it's not hard at all to top dmg charts as AP karma in lane.

Of course, wave management, objective taking, counter jungling and ganking are all hidding from shallow waters. Even high elo streamers, always after game ends they check their damage done. As if that's a consolidation after a defeat. ""I did good"". But did you? Let's say League was about kills and death match. Even then, it's a TOTAL damage done, through out the whole game. So you could inflate it while poking in lane, but then be totally useless when it matters (getting caught out, or not being usefull during big team fights near objectives).

I have a friend and who didnt even know sylas was out. This was 2 days after his release and he has played multiple games while the home screen had sylas stuff on it.

honestly some people just seem so clueless. I understand if you take time off and dont know anything when you get back. but to miss a new champ release despite playing games regularly. 

This friend also have no idea when builds change or whats strong in bot lane. 

Sure some of you are high elo and havent read patch notes but youre mostly good at the game and understand it. Low elo players  suck at this game and dont understand it. Even if the patch notes go over your head being able to identify kayle has been nerfed and probably wont do a well as before is a good place to start. Especially if youre playing ranked on first day of new patch 


but seriously. How do people not know about aram bans. Riot had a blog thing about aram changes and it was in patch notes. I dont take aram seriously but i still scrolled through the blog thing to see what was happening and checked the patch notes (albeit more for what champs got buffed/nerfed)",leagueoflegends

1175,ARAM Changes,"I feel like the banning component introduced today is useless.  Why?  Because ARAM doesnt have a meta that evolves much.  Champion design such as poke, range, sustain, etc. determine the impact the champion has on ARAM more than balance changes designed for summoner's rift.  Because of this, riot made balance changes specifically for ARAM, buffing or nerfing overall damage on certain champions based on their winrates.  Even so, the ARAM meta is very static, and champions that the playerbase finds meta will be banned every single game.

Furthermore, people might say banning can help balance teams and tone down one sided games.  This is unfortunately not true.  The champion picks are random with only randomized rerolls.  So teams are also entirely based off of rng.  So with everything being so rng based, is the banning system really needed?

Those are my thoughts on the ARAM changes.  I personally find them unhealthy for the gamemode.  However, i could be missing some crucial points, so feel free to share your opinion.",leagueoflegends

1192,Why did we not want Irelia in mid lane again?,"I'm only asking because I love the champion but I really, really don't like playing top lane. It's so removed from most of the action in the game (it feels like an island for the first 20 minutes) and the enemy jungler can just decide who wins the top lane matchup if they want to. What I loved about Irelia mid was that, as a Yasuo main, I had another champion that had basically the same play style so I could enjoy and feel like I was on a comfort pick every game, rather than only on the games when I get Yasuo. What was wrong with that? She stopped being cancer mid lane as soon as her e was shortened, and she much more belongs there since mid-lane is all about plays and outplays, whereas top lane is all stat checks. I have to imagine it's terrible playing against Irelia top lane with a stat check champion, as she has so many tools to use against you and you just have to guess at whether you're going to be able to do enough damage before she uses them.

The little Mundo had tanked 10 tower shots 2 ignites and executioners culling. All so his team could keep wiping us under turret in base. This continued until 40 minutes. This Mundo must have had a pretty good score you might say. Well he ended the game 3/3/18. He left lane 3/3/1. At the end of the game he did the most damage in the game just a small margin nothing significant just 20k more than the 12-7 full build adc, But the best part of it all was the counter-play that riot games gave to me, i felt so powerful with my ignite and mortal reminder. To bad even with all the tools and a score of 7/3/13 with two more items than mundo i just got outplayed. Truly i was just completely outplayed in every way possible. The way mundo hit R was just too much for my feeble fingers. His impressive creep score of 113 cs at 30 minutes was just too much for my wood 4 brain. Truly i have been blessed. Touched by the god that is Dr.Mundo and the patch 9.7, let this be a warning or a message to the weak of spirit. Id rather ban mundo than irelia, akali, zed, sylias, and pyke.

I ban Darius personally because I play toplane, and Darius on the enemy team means you basically dont ever get to lane. But no matter what I play, Vayne always shits on my team. Even if she gets dumpstered in lane she will still have 2 items at 18-20 min. Bork + Guinsoos is 6300 gold. Triforce alone is almost 4000gold but even if a bruiser is really strong, there is just no way to reliably teamfight against her. The ult + constant Q spam has literally no counterplay other than picking malphite and hoping that shes braindead. It does not matter who you play since, shes dealing insane damage, peeling for herself with E and Bork Slow, kiting you while having insane movement speed gains from her passive and ult. Like its too much.

I dont care how fed a Cait, Jinx, Twitch or Draven is. When a 6 item Renekton jumps on you, in a teamfight when your support is dead, you should be dead. End of story. Vayne on the other hand, can dance around your entire team in stealth and have you standing there like an idiot unable to target her.

Apex legends: 22 gun skins (mostly common however), 900+ crafting materials, 9 skins.

League of legends: 6500-8000 blue essence, 5 skins ( no rare or legendary skins) 

Overwatch (it’s been awhile since I’ve played but this is an estimate from last year): 15 loot boxes, 15+ skins, 10+ voice lines, 10+ accessories. 

Two of these are free games the other you can get for about 10-30 dollars depending if they’re on sale.

I get that riot is a free game, and at times can be hurting for cash but, after playing this game for almost 4 years I just wish it rewarded more loyal players who put a lot of time into it.

I know its Ironic to ask for change because you're tired of seeing change, but Its time to solve the problems with the Jungle.

The following questions need answers:

- When / Why do I gank?

- When / Why do I farm?

- How many jungle camps do I need to clear to hit level 6

- Should I be the same level as our mid laner or our support?

- Why does scuttle exist?

- Should I get the same Exp for lane minions as our mid laner? Should they get the same Exp for Jungle monsters as me?

- How gold reliant should I be on farming jungle?

- How penalizing should counter jungling be?

- Should champion kill exp be reduced?

- How far away from minions should I have to be in order to leech exp?



**Riot** These questions need to be answered in the form of gameplay changes. There should be a reason for me to invade the enemy, I should be penalized for fail ganks, I shouldn't have to be reliant on my laners to get gold and exp (scuttle).

Maybe even more so because the usual short lifespan of URF encouraged playing for stupid amounts of time and burn out on the game. I wouldn't mind if it became a permanent gamemode, LoL does have the playerbase for it and after so many years since it's original release it isn't very new anymore either way.

The balance changes were very well done and expanded the pool of viable champions by quite a lot. The only questionable balance changes were how extremely strong and game-determining Dragons were and that GP may have been slightly overbuffed as his damage became quite insane.

The color of the dress from a ""yellow pee"" to something more golden/champagne, with a bright pattern that imitates sequins  and instead of a leather jacket, a fluffy jacket.  They are very small changes but I think they would improve the skin a lot giving a more ""fashionista"" look.

1246,"I'd love some kind of SR ""Laning Mode""","When practising a Champion it would be great if you could pick a position (Mid / Top / Bot / Supp) and then be paired into a 1v1 or 2v2 (solo or duo) on Summoners Rift versus other players so you can practice the laning phase. 

You'd blind select a Lane Assignment and Champion and then go into queue. You would be allowed say 2 or 3 dodges per game so if a match-up came up you really didn't want you could skip it. Once paired with another player/s you'd have a few seconds to choose summoners and runes and to smack talk them a bit :) 

On loading into SR, only your chosen lane would have minions or towers. Jungle camps would be active except for the blue/red buffs and crabs (there also would be no Drakes or Rifty). There would be no other restrictions but if the game could detect that a player wasn't spending any time in proximity to minions (i.e. they were spending most time out of lane) then they would be defeated immediately to try and reduce griefing. 

You would spawn into the map straight at the outer towers with minions arriving 15-20 seconds later so games were quick to start. The game would end when a tower falls or when one player reached a certain gold lead (say 1,000 or 1,500). There might also be a max CS/gold that ends it too or a time limit (say 10-15 minutes).

I can't imagine this would require huge amounts of coding and it would be a quick, fun way to spam games with a champion and get used to how they play. ",leagueoflegends

1261,"A complete list of all the bugs in League of Legends, sorted by importance, with explanations, reproduction information and examples","Hey guys! I’m the Mordekaiser bug catcher. I spent years practicing by honing my skills, analyzing the most seasoned and most *al dente* spaghetti that League has to offer, and now that Riot is about to take away from me the only thing I’m doing in life by reworking Mordekaiser, I spent months to finally achieve my true goal: listing all of the bugs in League of Legends. For each of them, I’ll develop on its impact on the game, explain how to reproduce it, and provide screenshots or videos of the bug. 

Let’s dive into it! 

---

**1) Kha’Zix**

Without a doubt the most impactful bug that can be found on League. It has on its own turned the tide of countless games, even all the way up to the competitive scene, and it’s appeared regularly ever since late 2012, six and a half years ago. 

People affected by this bug have reported numerous consequences. Instantaneous death, appearance of an enemy champion out of nowhere, flying insects on the screen, sudden urge to complain on Reddit about how there’s too much damage in the game right now… A certain top laner, rumored to be on the new Bread Roster, even mentioned that bug stopping his backdoor attempt. You get the idea, though – this bug can take many forms and is an unseen threat to plenty of players.

**Reproduction information**

Before anything else, let’s dive into the reproduction information of this bug. I have analyzed it to provide you with the exact steps on how to get it to happen in your game, and the result is shown [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhAIlLiWxnI&amp;feature=youtu.be). These steps have a 100% chance of making the bug appear. 


**History of the bug**

Now, here’s one interesting thing about this bug… It has been in the game ever since 2012, and Riot has tried to get rid of it many times, but it’s always found a way to come back in the game, evolving to overcome the squashes. Apparently, change is good for that bug. 

It took different forms over the years, but I am nigh certain that it was always the same bug. Here is how it manifested itself. 

- End of 2012: First appearances of the bug, and we could definitely taste the fear of many players as a bouncy boi would get pentakills by jumping everywhere and throwing spikes in the air. 

- Early 2013: After the initial appaearances, the bug took an odd form. Spaghetti and broccoli must have not gone well together, and we got some Korean reports of a Kha’Zix staying immobile under his turret while being killed by the enemy mid laner. 

- 2014: The jumping cannon launcher was gone, but the bug was back and more resilient than ever. Unseen more often than not, and the bug wouldn’t take that much of a hit while invisible. 

- The bug then disappeared for a long time, but reappeared in 2017, being able to go from one base to the other one without being seen once. Some claim that the reason why it went unnoticed for two years was because that was the duration of his stealth, close to rivaling that of Morgana’s binding. 

The terror caused by this bug during that year caused Riot to try and squash it one more time, but once again, it managed to come back into the game. It is currently not at its strongest point, but is sharpening its claws, in position for ambush.

What’s interesting with this bug is that different elos seem to know how to adapt to it differently. Just like how EU players from 2013 learned to play with server lag, how TSMA players learned to play with a chair as their support, and how NA players learned to ignore the pointless lanes that are the side lanes, low elo players learned how to handle that bug and how to turn its occurrences into advantages rather than disadvantages. 

Let’s look at the win rate in every elo. 

https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/282712857538330624/561342026399088640/unknown.png

As we can see, the higher the rank, the more damaging this bug gets, and this is consistent. This can mean two things: either the higher elo players know how to abuse the bug better, or the higher elo players are too stubborn to play around the bug and adapt to it. But since all Reddit users are challenger (and thus all challengers use Reddit, due to size limits), and since all r/leagueoflegends users are stubborn, it’d have to be the second option. 

Luckily for you, I have mustered all my bug knowledge and understanding of the game to provide you with some ways to reduce the impact of this bug, should you end up being affected. There are several methods. 

**a) Reduce the effectiveness of the bug.**

Reduce the effectiveness. Simple on paper, thankfully simple to execute as well. For those who don’t have it in mind, refer to [that](https://img.rankedboost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pokemon-Lets-Go-Type-Chart.jpg) table. Simply equip items that give you a favorable type – fire, fighting, flying, fairy, poison, ghost or steel. If you really struggle with the bug, don’t hesitate to pair up two of these types. 

**b) Use the tools provided by Riot Games™ to minimize any problem that’s happening to you.**

If you’re a seasoned player, you should know that Riot Games always looks to make each of their characters fun to play as and against, and has thus always ensured that each situation offers its share of counterplay, as demonstrated by this [outstanding move](https://youtu.be/6h7O1YAkCxY?t=31).  

Here are a few strategies that you can adopt to neutralize the bug.  
**A)** Pink wards the damage done.  
**B)** Try using Cleanse.  
**C)** Slow it enough to reduce its movement speed by 5.  
**D)** Win the game.

Hopefully, one of these four strategies can help you reduce the damage caused by this bug.

**c) Prevent the bug from happening.**

That option is probably the trickiest, but outstanding modern problems require illegal moves beyond science. Here’s a video tutorial on how to do this (done in a custom game with tool assist since I’m not confident enough to pull that off in a real game yet): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0VOB624JAs

---

And that, was a list of all the bugs on League of Legends! I hope this can help the devs squashing them once and for all, and that I managed to give you enough tools to play around it. It would be about time something were done about it, since it’s been around for so many years. I understand that Riot hasn’t really been able to put that many resources onto it because of how much investment they’ve put on fixing Mordekaiser’s bugs, but Kha’Zix should definitely leap to a higher priority.

&amp;#x200B;

Rainbow drake: instead of 4 random drakes Combine all the elements into 1 drake but with reduced stats respectively. this will eliminate RNG and will reward every aspect of the game for those who go for it multiple times the first drake would be a negligible buff to everything but as they ramp up your power in all categorise grow. You can also skip a drake or two sacrificing late game power to get something immediately so it doesn't ruin strategy you dont need to go for every single one if its tuned properly

&amp;#x200B;

2nd Suggestion is to add a 5th Drake the Gold drake. 

Gold drake existed in the early years while i understand why it was removed having insane battle stats like infernal or mountain is no different.

&amp;#x200B;

3rd Suggestion Rainbow Drake added into the mixer but this will cause more RNG but if you have multiple good ones it might balance out, So you would have it included with the other drakes and like the first suggestion it would have abit of everything.",leagueoflegends
1267,GamersOrigin vs Misfits Premier - Post Match Discussion (LFL),"Didn't see it anywhere, but it's still a ""semi-final"" of the LFL, which is probably the second most or most competitive league in Europe so here it is :

Misfits Premier qualify for EU Masters 2019 and face Team LDLC in the final of LFL Spring. They previously defeated Vitality Bee and ROG School to get here.

The GamersOrigin roster was composed of SmittyJ (ex-H2K), Pride (ex-Roccat), SozPurefect (ex-TCL), Tonerre (Low-cost Perkz) and Hustlin (ex-Giants/NIP), so Misfits Premier have all their chances against the apparently untouchable roster of LDLC. The final (tomorrow 7PM) will be quite a match.

1268,Single Buff to fix Amumu,"Hello I would like to suggest a simple q buff that would allow Amumu better gameplay quality without changing his kit. I believe changing Amumu's Q ability (bandage toss) to have a CDR reset similar to Nautilus Q is huge. The current cd at level 1 is 16 seconds making his combo very hit or miss since it's your only engage to land your other abilities. By allowing CDR reduction of his Q for successful landing it his ability to escape through the jungle, peel, engage would all be enhanced and it would raise his skill cap by requiring more skill shots to be landed. Obviously damage would have to be lowered to compensate but it would be a great update that would increase his skill cap once balance. ",leagueoflegends

1280,LEC Playoff format is (potentially) seriously flawed.,"**TLDR; If the 3rd seed (winner of round 1 teams) is really weak, it is actually optimal to sandbag and lose the 1st/2nd seed match if it means you can see your opponent's strategies without revealing your own.**

Pretend for a moment that, instead of three strong teams in the LEC playoffs, you have two. For example, its G2, Origen, and a bunch of monkeys.

Here is how, lets say G2, can exploit this format.

G2 can hide all their special picks against Origen when they first meet, and just play as standard as possible. All they need to do is force Origen to show their cards, even if it means eventually losing the series. Now, when finals weekend comes, G2 can sweep the weak 3rd seed, roll up to the finals, and smash Origen because G2 have perfect preparation on Origen's pocket picks, while Origen know nothing about G2. And as G2 lifts the trophy, Origen can only wonder why they tried so hard when they first played G2.

**Why is this bad?** Because it encourages light sandbagging in a playoff game, even if it means you lose.

**How is this different than if Team Liquid sandbags against Flyquest to hide their strats before finals?** Because if Flyquest actually pushes TL to the brink, TL needs to try hard because they can't afford to lose. G2 *can* afford to lose to Origen if it means they get an information advantage.

**But Fnatic are real strong!** Luckily, or this might be an actual problem.",leagueoflegends

1289,Jarvan's Speech upon the verge of Demacian Civil War,"*""We can only succeed together"":*

A speech that Jarvan takes in the most desperate of times when Demacia threatens to be torn apart and consumed by self-conflicts.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Welcome, brothers and sisters.

Today I have come before you not as your prince, but as a human being and a fellow Demacian, with a message that every person who cares for Demacia should hear.

Since the very beginning of our kingdom, we Demacians have been on a journey; a decades-long journey towards a better future, towards a strong and safe land of justice and values. The journey continues to this very day; we may have climbed the high cliff and found our land, formed our kingdom, but we have yet to secure a good and safe future for us all.

In today's journey, Demacia stands on the edge of the cliff we climbed, surrounded by enemies. It must proceed with great caution to not slip down the cliff as it fights its foes to become the safe and thriving kingdom we all wish it to be.

Recently, there have been many events that threaten the balance Demacia needs as it stands on the cliff's edge; from the prison break of Sylas, through the growing mage rebellion, to the firmer steps and actions that were taken in the effort of protecting us all from hostile magic.

Those events are potentially the most significant threat Demacia had ever faced. More than the swords of our enemies - we need to fear the swords of ourselves, and those events had bad consequences on us all.

We have lost the way.

Hollow definitions changed the way we treat and look at each other.

Fears and prejudice divided us.

In the name of Demacia and justice, we misjudged our own brothers and sisters and brought misery upon them.

Many people think that Demacia was built as a refuge from magic. Indeed, throughout Demacian history magic has been perceived as a destructive force, but that is a shallow explanation.

Demacia was built as a refuge from the destruction that people had caused. Those people may have wielded magic, but blaming magic for the damage done is like blaming a sword for the misdeeds of a raider.

People should not be persecuted for possessing powers, they should only be judged if they misuse them.

More than to be willing to judge by definitions, we need to be willing to use our conscience and be open-minded; while there is only one truth, there are many ways to approach it.

We must remember that we Demacians are all humans. We are all brothers and sisters, and we are all equal; whether we are skilled with spears or with spells. Our ancestors; mages and non-mages alike, have stood together and made the same sacrifice in their creation and protection of the Demacian dream.

Our very nature as Demacians cries out for brotherhood, it cries out for the goodness in us and the unity of us all - despite our differences. So before taking pride in being a good Demacian, first take actions in being a good human, for if we let minor differences take our values away, we are bound to fall down the high cliff we stand upon today along with our dreams and future, and the efforts and blood of our ancestors and families would go to waste.

There are those who thrive on our separation and despair. They are dangerous to Demacia, to the dream that our ancestors sacrificed themselves for, and to the chance that we will have for a better life - together.

You must not listen to them. Our only hope for the future is to be **TOGETHER**. Refuse the shallow definitions that you hear around you. Look into the hearts of your surrounding; they are your brothers and sisters, who will live next to you in peace and die next to you in war. Enough enemies await us outside our borders, and they don't care whether we use magic or not. If we allow separation within us we will lose before they would even siege our walls.

Each and every one of us - from youths to elders - shall then be careful in the actions that we take every day, for they directly define Demacia and the success of our journey.

I stand before you today to encourage you to despise extremism and embrace the middle ground.

A total answer is never a good one; our journey is in a complex situation, thus we need to choose a complex solution over a definite, single-sided one.

In the name of Demacia, in the name of all the good we have achieved and have yet to achieve, and in the name of all the misery of those who are dear to us, I call each and every one of you to stand united in our journey, to help regain our balance when we need it most.

Say **no** to separation; spread the unity of us all.

Say **no** to persecution; embrace fair trial.

Say **no** to blind judgment; spread true justice.

Say **no** to prejudice; embrace the common between us.

Say **no** to hatred; spread love and kindness.

Say **no** to ego and cheap tags; embrace your surroundings as they are.

We must all remember that our journey to Demacia is still not over. It is not the time to allow differences to get between us. We must unite and act from love to each other and to Demacia. We must abandon hate, violence, and thought that we are superior, or we become as bad as our enemies, and Demacia will be destroyed and scattered to a thousand pieces.

Our only way and hope to succeed is to stand together. Let’s keep our weapons for our enemies and embrace each other with our hearts against the darkness that surrounds us. That is the true strength of Demacia, the reason it was created, and the reason we can stand here today.

Demacia's name and future start now, they start with you.

Let the forces of our nation empower you. Stand united. Demacia counts on you - now more than ever.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

1290,"[Idea] Allow us to ""pre-select"" the champ we want to hover in lobby before pick/ban phase","Sorry if this is incorrectly formatted or has been suggested before- first time post here.

&amp;#x200B;

With the very limited we have during champ select (not complaining), I think it would be useful to have already hovered the champ that you would like to or know you usually play. Could also do the same thing for bans, since I mostly only ban the same one or two champs.

&amp;#x200B;

Example:

I queue up as Jungle/Support preferred, with Jax as my preferred Jungle and Thresh as my preferred Support. And Vayne as my preferred ban (cause screw that broken champ amirite).

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously if those are picked or banned by the other team or whatever, then it goes away just like they do now.

I'm lazy and afk a lot to do things while waiting for queue pop and picks, so thought this would be helpful. Hope you guys do as well, thanks for reading",leagueoflegends

1293,Information about a set of skins in early brainstorming phase.,"**Overview**

These skins aren't yet in production, but they're a very supported idea by the skins department/team at Riot. They're meant to be a certain form of follow-up to K/DA, but only in terms of aesthetic. The whole idea behind them is to embrace the ""Champion X has too many skins"" meme. This is all I know:

 **Skins Thematic**

 The main idea behind them is to turn five female champions into supermodels that are dressed in highly fashionable clothes that resemble those from Gucci, Louis Vuitton etc. They're also meant to make said champions look wealthy and fit the K/DA universe which they're a part of. The champions that will most likely get these skins are:
-Lux
-Miss Fortune
-Morgana
-Riven 
-Vayne

**Ideas I've heard for each champion**
  
**Lux:**

-A long ponytail as a new hairstyle

-A high-low hem dress decorated with gems

-Prismatic/gemlike animations

**Miss Fortune:**

-An elegant suit with puffy shoulders

-Her guns as cash canons

-A wave of banknotes for her ult 

-Diamond rain

**Morgana:**

-Overall much warmer color palette

-High-waisted and wide-legged pants

-No specific idea for the wings yet

**Riven:**

-Straight mid-length hair

-Sequin dress with short black pants

**Vayne:**

-Short rose gold hair

-Similar colorful design in stealth to K/DA Akali

**Overall:**

-They'll all strike a pose at the end if their recalls for synchronisation.

-Like the K/DA skins, all will get prestige versions if the initial release is a success",leagueoflegends
1295,Hot take?-LCS is boring?,"To me watching LCS is boring.  I'm a solo Q player and do not find enjoyment out of watching high skilled players playing the true 5v5 game.  I'd much rather watch pros streaming their solo Q games.  Is this weird?  Solo Q is my game, which feels so much different than LCS.  That coupled with the fact that so many roster changes happen over the years that It's hard for me to care about a certain team.  There are a few pros that I like to watch via  solo q stream, but they are all split between retired/current teams.

edit: It might also be worthy to note that team loyalty/competition is something that is foreign to me.  I do not watch or care about any type of sport.

What I am not okay with is that every time a new champ pops up Riot immediately hits them with the nerf hammer. We just saw this with the recent Urgot nerfs. If Riven is allowed to be strong and untouched, let other champs have their day in the sun. If other strong top lane champs are allowed maybe Riven and Jax will feel less oppressive.

1299,Tank items don't scale exponentially yet they are inefficient. thats why tanks suck.,"besides a few. thats why tanks have to have overloaded damage to be good. look at sejuani. that champion is practically a juggernaut now, her kit has more base damage than most juggernauts now


if you look at tank items from the lol page. you will see that most tank items sit at 70-80% gold efficiency. which means. they are shit. yes am being blunt here. but thats quite frankly the truth



4 years ago. here is what dead mans plate stats looked like

600 HP. 

50 ARMOR. 

2750 price.


Dead mans plate now

425 HP

60 armor.

2900


4 years ago. Sunfire was 2600 gold

50 armor

500 health

now. its 2750.

425hp

60 armor. not as big as the other item. but these items were already not that efficient.

this goes for all tank items. its plain and simple. either make Tank items better. or make the resistance to damage reduction formula work better. make tank items scale off other tank items instead of increasing damage. maybe?. sort of like how IE scales off other crit in an adc build.


It doesn't make any sense for IE to be 111% gold efficient without other crit and potentially more scaling . and a tank item that will be worth-less to your overall tankiness the more tank items you buy


psuedo tankiness is working way better than real tankiness anyway, hp and resistances are just target to deal more damage. from % hp damage and penetration to resistances. these stats not only come from items that aren't that efficient. don't scale well. but also lose value depending on what items you buy

its not bruisers top lane. many tanks have better matchups top than many bruisers. its just that the items are crap. they are trash. nobody wants to build a tank item over a damage item unless your going against assassin. it just doesn't work. 


tanks have been relegated to gargoyle stoneplate to feel tanky. because otherwise even a poppy with 4k hp and 200+ resistances will die in 3 seconds due to how many % damage amp comes from runes and you get hit by that 3-4 keystones+someone is cleaving your armor here and there. % hp damage here. true damage there. just doesn't work well


Just make tankiness scale better. make items more efficient. don't make sejuani do a million damage. like she doesn't need to kill people if she can survive and be desruptive and do some damage that others can follow up on",leagueoflegends

I personally rarely ff at 15 in normal or ranked because i know that in low elo (i'm silver), ANYTHING can happen and it doesn't really get decided till late game. However, if all lanes are feeding, i do ff. If one lane isn't i just try to get carried. It's not so bad to get carried. No one in my elo thinks this way though 'cuz most will ff at 15 if they're feeding, regardless of how everyone else is doing. The games that really ruffle my feathers are those where I'm carrying my feeding team while they grieve and yell to report me because I won't ff instantly.

I feel something very similar happening with this wit's end change. It's not as if nobody is building the item, it's perfectly viable and usable in specific situations. On auto heavy champs on midlane, like irelia or yasuo, or on marskmen into ap burst mages with some magic penetration under their belt. With this change, you completely remove what's unique about the item, and in exchange, you're giving it pseudo lifesteal. How exciting. Another item that can be abused by a select, privileged group of champs, while massive itemization gaps still remain unfilled due to a lack of diverse options.

Now, I know that Overwatch has that and this would be a ripoff, yeah.. but eh, like people ain't doing that already  
  
Anyways, think of for example High Noon Lucian that could touch up his hat and say his already existing quote [""Miss""](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/7/71/LucianHighNoon029.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20181017071930) for females or just [""Howdy""](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/2/2b/LucianHighNoon107.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20181017072223) for males or something?  
  
Basic skins could work without sound or with it if they have proper quotes.

I could already see Mundo making a silly fast-paced waving animation like a child, while Fiddlesticks would stop waving mid-animation and Warwick could have his claws pop-out as the animation is ending and he starts grinning xD  
  
There could also be simple animations, usually with more.. serious characters - Darius, Swain, Camile, Pyke, Hecarim etc. Just nodding or briefly raising the hand to greet  
    
Out of all champions, I am just not sure how viable would this be for KhaZix and maybe Skarner.. as well as, should all champions have friendly /hello or could some end up with something similar as [RekSai taunt](https://youtu.be/tSBpIxbMcnM?t=18)?

1320,Re-balance more runes.,"This upcoming patch riot is changing the entire 2nd tier of the domination tree. Along with them re doing Conq a few patches back I wish they would do this more often. A Rune that doesn't seem to really do much besides a few cases right now is PTA.  Very rarely is it better to take PTA over any of the other Keystones for precision. Maybe adding in something like a movement debuff on champs that are affected by PTA once it procs could be nice keeping it viable to take for chasing and kiting. Even allows it to be good for melee champions or jg. It doesn't give it a damage boost, or change how the keystone should function, but it allows something to add to make it compete more against other keystones.",leagueoflegends

Where u could participate from silver 2+(or even gold)

Get placed low silver and be content with my ranking. This season though I want to at least get gold so I can finally have a victorious skin.

Here's the thing though. I've probably played around 120ish ranked games and my LP gains are the same as my losses. I gain about 17-19 per game and lose 17 per loss. I know that low LP gains can be caused by a low MMR. But I don't think it's under what my current rank should be. Is there any way I can increase my LP gains?

1348,What riot has done for IG is unfair for the other world champions,"As a fan of League I have been loyal to this game since season3. I've pretty much enjoyed whatever this game offered to us and as a part of it, I've watched every world championship since then. Now to bring up the main point, we have to go through few policies that riot has mentioned. There is a lot but lets uncover one&lt;related to my post&gt;
1. There wouldn't be a separate xayah rakan skin

And we also have to keep in mind with the ward skin.

Well, riot has told us there wouldn't be a singular skin for this couple. That's one of the reasons that CoreJJ and Ruler picked it as a couple. However they just went off with their rules so sudden for this Rakan skin. It could be seen as a tedious problem but the main issue is that they also broke their word of 'no champ is allowed to be picked same time in a row as a dedication for the world champions'. Rakan was already finished with CoreJJ and I believe it wouldn't be too happy for him.
This matters a lot because Bang from SKT wanted so Ez much but was turned down because of the TPA skins. You could also call for Faker because he wasn't allowed his Ahri skin since Riot was going to release the Popstar skin for her. If they were to keep their words Riot should have turned down Baolan's request.

Now to the second point, I have to admit that the ig ward skin was well made but this is also very unfair. To think of it, Kkoma from skt wanted his ward skin back in 2014 but riot said no, telling him to win worlds 3times. Similarly Choi Woo-Beom didn't get one since he only won 2times as a coach. But,how can Wang Sicong get a skin, in his first win?? I know League is now a China owned company, and they're enjoying their first domination in 8 seasons but I believe they have to hold their horses and be, or at the very least try to be fair to all teams and countries.

1349,League Client : Display runes,"Forgetting to set your runes in the champion select lobby is a death sentence in this current meta where runes do so so much.

As such, why on earth are your selected runes hidden inside a drop-down menu with only the active page's name displayed.

Why not use the wasted space on the bottom right of the client in champ select to display the rune icons for the current page, and allow you to set them accordingly.

1359,Watching LCK I just realized how flawed the LEC playoff system is,"LCK wants regular season to have an high impact, so their playoffs are gauntlet format where the last 2 seeds in playoffs play each other and the winner plays the upper team and so on.

The LEC system rewards regular season performance for only the top 2 teams, who can get straight to finals after 1 bo5 and even have a second chance if they lose the first bo5. The other 4 teams basically get nothing, other than 3rd seed gets to choose their opponent, which hardly matters because they have to play 2/3 teams below them anyway. Winning playoffs requires winning 4 bo5's for the 3-6 teams, which is equal to winning LCK playoffs from the wildcard match. I don't think this is fair.",leagueoflegends

1364,"New Champion Reveal: Helmet Bro, the Void Knight","#Overview: 

Helmet Bro is a melee AP bruiser who uses the Void's own dark powers against them, relying on crippling silences and slowly wearing down his opponents, while shrugging off their own retaliation. Helmet Bro is a dogged warrior, unflinching in his resolve and implacable in his advance. The creatures of the Void will come to fear the name of Helmet Bro.

#Abilities:

**Passive - Void Blade:** Helmet Bro's basic attacks deal 5(Level)+(0.25AP) bonus magic damage.

**Q - Dodge Roll/Ashen Strike:** Helmet Bro nimbly rolls a short distance away. For three seconds afterword, Helmet Bro's next attack becomes Ashen Strike, allowing Helmet Bro to leap 600 units to an enemy's location, dealing additional magic damage and silencing them.

Bonus Magic Damage: 30 / 55 / 80 / 105 / 130 (+0.40 AP) Cooldown: 8 seconds

Silence duration: 2 seconds.

**W - Cloak of Shadows:** Helmet Bro raises his cloak, gaining a temporary spell shield that lasts two seconds. If Cloak of Shadows absorbs a spell, Helmet Bro releases the spell's energy, dealing the spell's damage type in an area around him (425 units). The spell does not copy the enemy spell's damage, only the damage type.

Damage: 75/95/115/135/155

Cooldown: 14 seconds.

**E - Void Blast: Passive:** Helmet Bro stores charges for each spell used by a nearby enemy champion in his helmet. His helmet can hold six charges, and charges deteriorate one at a time every three seconds.

Active: Helmet Bro releases a blast of Void energy in a thin line from his helmet, dealing magic damage and slowing the first enemy champion in the line. The spell does 10% bonus damage for each charge stored in the helmet before using Void Blast.

Magic Damage - 0 charges: 70/115/160/205/250 (+0.50 AP)

Magic Damage - 6 charges: 112/184/256/328/400 (+0.50 AP)

Cooldown: 16/14/12/10/8 seconds.

**R (Ultimate) - The Purge:** Helmet Bro draws his brother's sword, and stabs it into the ground. The blade releases its stored Void energy for six seconds, dealing magic damage and perpetuating a Silencing field around a small area (500 units). Enemies cannot cast spells while in the area, and Helmet Bro gains bonus magic resistance while standing in the Silencing field.

After the six seconds the Silencing field collapses in on itself, dealing magic damage to them.


Magic Damage - Explosion: 200/325/450 (+0.45 AP)

Magic Damage - Implosion: 225/375/500 (+0.45 AP)

Bonus Magic Resist: 45/60/75

#Quotes:

**In champion select:**

""Kai'sa is hot.""

**Movement:**

""I'm gay but no one will see this""

""Ok""

""What the fuck, support is so easy.""

""Everyone else is trash.""

""Go next.""

""gg shit jungler""

**Attacking:**

""He literally doesn't do anything""

""YOU HAVE NO MANA""

""ORA ORA ORA ORA""

**Joke:**

Helmet Bro takes off his helmet, balancing it on the tip of his sword.

""I'm not a fan of any region or team, I am just a fan of whoever is playing the best League of Legends in the world. And right now, that just happens to be Team Solo Mid.""

**Taunt:**

Helmet Bro points his sword forward as it glows and crackles with purple energy.

""Ladies and gentlemen, we got him""

#Lore:

**February Nineteenth, Institute of War, Eastern Outskirts;**

My brother Valan and I, were contracted to guard the Institute's Eastern front. There were rumors of something approaching from there.

Void.

It was something from the void, according to the Summoners. Something that while dangerous, should pose little threat to two talented knights like Valan and I. We had our gear ready in an hour, and were hidden in the forest's edge before nightfall.

**February Twenty-First, Institute of War, Eastern Outskirts;**

Whatever it was, it came up on Valan in the night. We're trained warriors, dammit, how did he miss it?

That doesn't matter now. He's dead. Ashes. The only thing left of him was his sword and helmet, both crackling with a strange, violet energy.


Void magic.

Before I could even finish grieving the damned thing fired upon me with a beam of light; same thing that killed Valan, most likely. I managed to dodge it, barely. My cloak and sword were destroyed up to the hilt. I managed to run for a few meters before it caught up with me.

Gods, it was massive. Taller than the trees. Tentacles writhing, three smaller eyes crowned over one colossal retina, a dark slit that flattened as it was charging the blast to end my life.

Only, the blast never came. Summoners from the Institute had arrived, and barely managed to subdue the creature before it had killed me. They took it away with them, and brought me to the infirmary.

I never even got to bury Valan.

**February Twenty-Second, Institute of War, Infirmary;**

I'm fine, dammit, but they won't let me go back to the forest to bury Valan. They won't even let me leave this room they want me to stay for 'observation'.

They want me to stay so I won't kill them all.

I heard their plans, their whispers. They're letting that monster that THING live. The alien beast that killed my brother, took the only thing I cared about in this world from me, and they're letting it go. They're arranging a deal with it! It's going to stay at the Institute and compete in their accursed League, in exchange for knowledge! I'd heard that they dealt with monsters before, but this... This is sickening.

In a flash of dark light, something entered the infirmary, stunning the nurse sent to attend me. On instinct I rose to defend myself, but it was no threat.

It was salvation.

Kassadin, the League Champion, the Voidwalker, had come to me. He presented three things to me; Valan's sword and helmet, along with my own sword hilt, still crackling with that evil energy.

He spoke to me then. If you want revenge, take it. With that, he was gone.

I can never thank him enough.

Donning my equipment, I left the infirmary.

If they won't battle the darkness of the Void, then I will.

I'm not alone; Kassadin stands by my side, and Valan watches me from the afterlife.

Vel'Koz will pay. The Void will pay.

Valan Helmen is dead.

Marrak Helmen is dead.

The Helmet of my brother is all that remains.

1371,Should you be concerned about account security?,"Hello. I am not an active LoL player. I can not remember my last game. It was perhaps over a year ago. However, today I received an email telling me my account had been banned due to use of a third party program.

Despite not playing recently, I had spent some money on the account and earned many champions. Returning to playing has still been an ongoing consideration. I consider the account an asset so to lose it through no fault of my own displeases me.

I submitted a ticket detailing this. After doing so I looked at a stat site and, sure enough, there were details of recent games I had not played.

My current thoughts are: yes, this is a bit annoying, however, should I lose my account it is not the end of the world to me (as an inactive player). If I were an active player, I would be very concerned. A few google searches shows me this is a regular occurrence for League of Legends. 

Does Riot have piss poor security? How safe is your account, really?

Edit: I have seen other posts and user comments are always the same - it must have been my fault somehow so it couldn't happen to them. I don't even play the game anymore.

I understand Riot loves to keep LCS games interesting enough and stuff but you're sacrificing the average League player's satisfaction for some more LCS viewers instead. And I'm sure turret strength is only one of the things that functions the same way.

1454,Does gaining weight affect LP gains,"I know this is an unusual topic, but I heard from several high Elo players that you need to take care of your body to get better at league. I am not fond on exercise and eat more than the average person, as a result, I'm often tired or sleepy playing league. After meals, I noticed I'm irritable which makes me prone to tilt and  mistakes.

My peak Elo was after platinum 1, during preseason, one of my cats had gastric cancer and had to be put down. I barely ate for a brief period of time and managed to climb high enough to get an off stream game with pokimane.

My highest rank this season was platinum 2 52 LP, one explanation for getting the rank was because I did yard work for my neighbors that week. As a result, my body was in a better condition

Here's my [op.gg](https://op.gg) but I don't think it's relevant: [https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=ivurik](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=ivurik)",leagueoflegends
1456,Lets talk about what would be the best destination for Forg1ven.,"Forg1ven is a all time favorit of mine. His dominant laning and excelant team fighting was one of the reasons 2015 (his SK year) was one of the best years of League of legends for me. 

That being said I am a European fan and tho I will give my reasons the teams I have in mind where i think he could be best on, you can keep that in mind if you like. Now lets begin speculating. 

If we look only to the west I think Forig1ven should not join a NA team and I'll tell you why. Forg1ven cannot join TL, TSM, C9 or even 100t. Those teams have heavily invested in their adc's this year. And regardless I think Forg1ven will not enjoy the practice regime and team culture in NA. Forg1ven (suposedly) is a very die hard player that wan't for him and his team to be in 110%. House parties and Fortnite are probably gonna work on his nerfs. But if he is gonna join a LEC team which team can he join? I think there are a few contenders.

**1: Rogue:** I think Rogue needs Forg1ven and Forg1ven might need Rogue. Don't forget that Vander is still on the bench for that team and he both played with Forg1ven before and had a few outstanding games this split. Larssan (a talented masters mid laner) is also set to join Rogue this upcoming split and with Kikis in the jungle this team is starting to look very promissing indeed. It would be a great PR move by Rogue, sentering all the attention on their new lineup and Forg1ven is gonna be the star if they do. Rogue could go from last place to playoffs or even better if the stars aline for this team. And to go from Profit, Kikis, Sencux, HeaQ, Wadid to Profit, Kikis, Larssan, Forg1ven, Vander is gonna be super hype anyway you spin it.

**2: SK Gaming:** There is some history here, but in the last couple of weeks Crownshot had been hailed as the second best player in SK. Is it then likely he will be replaced? Maybe not, but replacing him for Forg1ven might be worth the risk. Forg1ven would have an amazing jungler and good support to work with. If both parties wanna take that chance is unknown, but there is potential here.

**3: Vitality (unlike):** It is unlikely to just happen, but frankly Vitality's bot side has let them down very often in playoffs and regular matches. Cabochard, Mowgli and Jizuke hav all performed up to or above expectations. And this team plays a style that requires lane dominance to work. What better way to sement that dominance then by adding Forg1ven to the mix. Forg1ven has played with mediocre supports before and he would have a team to religh on. Vitality needs Forg1ven and Forg1ven probably needs Vitality. But if both parties will reach out to one another is another question. 

**4: Origen (extremely unlike, but hella good):** Origen has a dream team. 5 very good players in each role. Partick is even shaping up to be a very strong adc, why then would you want to replace him with another adc and potentially ruin the synergy build up with these players. For one simple fact, this team is the wet dream team for Forg1ven. Mithy as his support, very strong solo laners, and a smart jungler. They have everything from the training regime, to the invrastructure, even a smart coach. Maybe this is wishfull thinking, but if any top team would take Forg1ven now, it would probably be Origen, unlikely as it might seem tho. ",leagueoflegends

1458,PSA: New Wit's End Deals Less Damage Than Current Until About Level 13,"Basically new wit's end is a worse rush item unless you very much value the sustain. You will be dealing less damage until around level 13 making it a better 3rd item choice for on hit champions in niche situations. From there it deals MUCH more on-hit damage than before. 

This is because current wit's end STEALS MR So until new wit's end hit's it 60 damage breakpoint(level 13) it won't be dealing more damage than current. 

Current Wit's End Gives:

* 20 more MR when stacked for a total of 70

* Costs 500 gold less(this is big to consider)

* It STEALS MR meaning it also increases the damage of other AP champions on your team hitting the same target as you. 

The trade off is that the new Wit's End.

* Gives less stacked MR, but higher base making you harder to blind side/poke

* It gives sustain when below 50% hp. Also making it harder to poke you.

* It gives MUCH more single target on-hit damage and attack speed than before post level 13 in exchange for team benefits/synergy.

Basically don't build it first item. I know current wit's end isn't really built as a first item either, but with buffs to the item people may assume getting it earlier is better. It's not.

building it 3rd item on hit champions is likely best.

1463,Why did we revert back to using NA time?,"Back in the days everything was based on NA time (PDT or whatever it's called) and everything started at the same time everywhere, except EU for example was 9 hours ahead with their days. As Riot and the region offices grew, it was changed so things can roll out independently on each regions, so each regions can get something at the same time during their days, which was great. But in the last couple of weeks/months, we reverted back to using NA time, everything rolls out at the same time everywhere. For example Your Shop is 1pm NA, 10pm EU.

It's irrelevant for something like Your Shop, but it's kinda unfair if for example a gamemode is only available for one weekend, because EU (and I assume Russia and Turkey as well) has less time to play. In NA you get home at 5 or 6pm (or maybe even earlier if you're in school) and the gamemode is already available, so you have a few hours on Friday to enjoy it + Saturday and Sunday of course. EU gets it late evening (9-10pm normally) so we have much less time during Friday. But wait, EU gets back that time at the end of the event, right? Sure. If it ends at 12am Monday, it will end at 9am in EU. Well guess what people are doing on Monday mornings... hint: not playing.

Technically we get the same amount of time, but thanks to time zones, we have a good couple less useful hours to play. If it was still Season 3, I would understand. If we never started using region times, I would understand. But we DID start using independent region times, which was convenient for everybody, but then Riot just decided to go back using NA time and this is not understandable. This is fucked.",leagueoflegends

1465,Applying pressure as a Jungler - Pathing and Ganking Meta,"Recently I found myself doing well on junglers who can go for that fast level 3 (Red, Krugs, Scuttle) and gank a lane for an almost guaranted kill. I think it's what's happening even in high elo (Diamond+) most of the time.

People get that level 3, gank a lane and start vertical jungling.

In lower elo (Platinum and below) junglers usually go into their jungle after being spotted and don't tend to vertical jungle because they can't rely on their team mates to follow.

I think that the lower elo meta right now is to camp the lane you ganked first time (kill the laner 2-3 times) and try to get the objective on that side of the map and than start camping the other side of the map + get the objective there.

An example of this gameplay is my yesterday's video playing [**Kindred against Lee Sin (Click to Open in YT)**](https://youtu.be/QzAyk59vSu8)

So why do we still loose lp and get locked into 4v5’s when someone connects for 20 seconds and then dc’s. It just isn’t fair, at the very least there should be no lp loss for the team with 4 members.

1475,A choice of greater confusion,"Hello fellow players,  


A few years a go, i lost my former LoL account, which made me buy IP and XP boosts to reach level 30 as fast as possible.

I saved all my IP to have enough to afford two runes pages: attack damage and magic damage. I reached level 30 in a few days since i played around a hundred games or more of the Blood Moon mode, which lasted 6 minutes and gave as much IP and XP as a real game. This fact caused me to reach level 30 with a very limited list of champions.   


With the not-so-recent revamp of runes and masteries, I now lost everything i had saved for using my IP boosts. Since the new way of acquiring ''blue essence'' is now lightly through games and much more through level ups, I recently questioned myself about the possibility of creating a new account.  


Let's think about it, if I am level 30, with practically no champions but the free-to-play ones, will it be significantly faster for me to acquire new champions if I begin at level 1, because i would benefit from the quicker level ups at earlier levels ?

now as jungler i don't have any problems with orn ofcourse, but as a laner i have. Now early it's okay, i know i can't kill him, so we mailny farm &amp; poke a bit, but the more the more the game progresses, the weaker i get against him.

Now with garen &amp; jax i mainly like to splitpush, it's working out really well this season but everytime i have to split against orn it's just impossible, the guy is so tanky but does so much damage at the same time it's insane, with gnar it's a bit easier but still he's so strong i don't get it.

1481,Tanks as a class are in need of buffs.,"Pretty self explanatory title. I feel like a lot of non-tank players don't really notice this, because a tank can still feel very relevant even in todays meta if they get the right CC off at the right time. But for a tank player it is pretty frustrating to play in the current meta. Toplane is an absolute no-go, with the only viable tanks up there being Poppy and arguably Sion, and in the jungle you're pretty restricted in champion selection too, along with being outperformed by the vast majority of fighter and assassin junglers. This really only leaves support as the viable role for tank players, which is honestly a pretty boring role and not one that most tanks are even suited for. 

[This image](https://i.imgur.com/tKL4WJP.png) is two little tables I made of tank winrates. The first table uses every tank, juggernaut, and two specialists that I decided were too much like tanks to not include (Cho'Gath and Singed). The second table uses only champions that fit into Riot's own classification for tank, so it has a few notable absences like Mundo and Volibear. You can pretty clearly see that the majority of champions in the red (Sub 48% winrate) are actually tanks, while in the green there are far more bruisers and fighters. While not everyone might agree that a winrate below 48% is a sign of a champion being underpowered, I think that combined with the fairly low pickrates of most of these champions is a pretty big indicator in that direction.",leagueoflegends

1485,Why kindred (in my opinion) is the worst champ right now,"Kindred is one of the weakest champions right now for multiple reasons, but I think it is primarily how she works and interacts with the meta. In order to really utilize Kindred's passive (aptly named mark of Kindred) you need to have a role that is mobile, ie. mid or jungle; that is not to say it cant be played top or bot but it doesn't utilize kindred to her utmost potential. 

&amp;#x200B;

Playing her jungle comes with a problem of having a somewhat slow beginning clear compared to most junlgers' (this picks up after first item) but already left somewhat behind. She has a somewhat decent dueling potential level 2, but after that is just left in the dust unless way ahead past the 7-8 min mark. So how is this a problem. mos games last up to 20, maybe 30 mins. Kindred if just even to her jungle mate is 9/10 outclassed until the \~25 mn mark (when you pick up your third item). Until then she is dead weight unless she picked up a couple lucky early kill. If she, god forbid, gets behind you are done. The enemy jungler decides to invade, you cant fight, lose farm unless you have a hard pushing top or mid that can help you. The jungle farm that you do get only goes so far (with the exp nerf a couple patches ago). Being behind your ganks are useless unless your lane mate does most of the fighting, and too many failed ganks just you more behind. So your stuck behind. Now what most junglers' do at this point is mitigate losses and hope to be carried. This is most Kindred games. You either hope to be carried or drag the game on as long as possible and reach end game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Playing her mid isn't the best either as if you really wanted to play a somewhat slippery marksman Ezreal, or heck even Vayne, fits the bill much better. They aren't even the best here, so why should you play someone worse.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude I would like to propose a solution to Kindred's problem, and that is to introduce a small root to her E. What I'm proposing is if you proc your e the enemy champ is rooted for like 1 sec, this will help with securing kills and getting away in deadly situations. ",leagueoflegends
1486,The Yasuo Rehabilitation Clinic - Donate Now!,"* Are you the only person that can carry your garbage team?
* Are you growing out a ponytail and are considering buying a katana?
* Do you maintain that Yasuo can fill every role in the game?
* Do Yasuo nerfs feel like a personal attack on your character?
* Have you lost control of your life?

Thousands of League players suffer from the crippling effects of being a Yasuo main every year. This horrible affliction affects not only themselves, but the team mates around them. Being a Yasuo main can lead to irritability, nappy rash, and in the worst cases, even permabanning. It starts with a quick test in a custom to see what he’s like, but can quickly spiral into playing him as a “counter pick” and ultimately maining Yasuo, even when he isn’t OP. 

It can feel like you are the only decent player on the entire TR server and that your team is conspiring to ruin every ranked game you have. That Riot Games themselves is trying to keep you down.

But we’re here to help.

Here at the Yasuo Rehabilitation Clinic, our goal is to help you get your life back on track. Our team of volunteers will provide you with the support and guidance that you need to become Yasuo free. 

We offer services including:

* Champion banning workshops.
* All chat role play sessions.
* Mid game meditation classes.
* Blood pressure medication.

We provide life changing services to those who need them, but to continue we desperately need your support. For as little as $2, you can provide the means for a Yasuo main to stop feeding the enemy team and ultimately get good.

The PCF has been helping people for over 30 years and runs programs all over the US to help Stop Cancer Before It Starts. They do very good work so if you can spare a little bit of change today then it will help massively.
