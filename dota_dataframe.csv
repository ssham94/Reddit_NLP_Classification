9,"As a support being told ""great job"", ""good gank"", ""that made us win the lane"" etc. really makes me happy!","No big reason behind this. Had a few good games today in which I was commended for a few good moves. Ganking mid while he was having a hard time, placing the right ward to give sight in a fight.

It's not often I have been told it was a good move or well played. So I just wanted to share and remind that good words help.

13,"Position Six Podcast featuring lizZard - talking about the difficulty balancing playing with casting, his 'persona' (or lack thereof) as a talent, the Dreamleague Major and much more.","Hello all!

I've released the latest episode (episode 21) of the Position Six Podcast, with one of the most exciting new casters and analysts, lizZard.

We spoke about the difficulty trying to be both a pro and a talent at the same time - and his belief in being a pro - how lizZard sees himself on screen, the Dreamleague Major, the weaknesses and struggles of the Balkans and much more.

Sorry to those of you who have been patiently waiting for the past 2 weeks for new episodes, I had a tonne of technical difficulties outside of my control and a guest let me down. I'm back on track now.

You can listen to the podcast here:

17,Charity Stream for Kitties !,"Hey guys, I'm bowie! You might know me from my youtube videos or more recently for some of my casts. 

For a while I've been looking for a way to give back all the love I found within the dota community. I remember a lot of charity streams in the past that were awesome and had great goals but I never found an org that I would like to give back to.

Until a friend of mine (one that saw the beginning) of my dota journey move to the city I live now. We used to live together because of college and even adopted this beautiful [fluffy ball](https://imgur.com/UHjRDyY) together . Her name is Kira and we adopted it through a local and small cat org called [gato miah](https://www.facebook.com/gatomiah/) . They might be small but they do a great job at it. They're all about ""responsible adoption"" meaning they want to know whether you have the means from reasonable wealth to provide the cat a good life to a residence with the appropriate nets to prevent the cat to run away.

They visited us and the process was amazing. I loved every second with this cat and my friend takes amazing care of her to this day. So yeah the goal here is to raise money for them so they can keep doing their job !

Their job is amazing because they're not only looking to find homeless cats owners. First they take care of all the ""problems"" that they might have from castrating them to any medical issues and they even try to pair the cats personalities with the owner! They help people that lost their cats to find them using their [page](https://scontent.fgru5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/55803425_2105654636168194_2443775407183364096_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fgru5-1.fna&amp;oh=96deefdd6447643ddeb4c337ed987eac&amp;oe=5D08064C)
Here are some cute pics from their facebook page:

My stream will be 12-24h long. I would like to say I'm 100% committing to 24h but since I never did it that's why I'm leaving it open and here's how things will work:

* **I will only play heroes that can summon creatures that are controlable : Beastmaster, Broodmother, Chen, Enigma, LD, Lycan, NP, Visage, Warlock.** 
* **For every Loss I will donate 5 dolars from my own pocket to them.**
* **Chat will be able to select which hero I'll play every game from an interactive poll but I will never play the same hero twice in a row**

* **All the money that comes from donations during the stream will also be directed towards gato miah**

* **The stream will happen on April 17 (Wednesday) time yet to be decided in my [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/d2bowi3)**


Edit: Vote [here](https://www.strawpoll.me/17738675) if you want more hero options that have ""creatures"" like luna, mirana, etc.

18,"Valve, please clean-up your cosmetics","There‚Äôs so many cosmetics that have broken or glitched out over the years, it‚Äôs really quite sad.

27,Some statistics surrounding qualifier slots.,"**Average placement for the Majors:**

NA: (7+7+13+3+9+13+3+9+9)/9 = 8,11

CIS: (1+13+13+2+2+13)/6 = 7,33

EU: (4+9+13+1+7+13+2+4+9)/9 = 6,88

China: (1+5+5+13+4+5+7+13+5+7+13)/11 = 7,09

SEA: (13+7+5+5+9+3+9)/7 = 7,29

SA: (9+9+9+9+9+13)/6 = 9,67

**Average placement for Minors:**

NA: (7+5+5+3)/4 = 5

CIS: (2+2+2+3)/4 = 2,25

EU: (7+5+5+4+5)/5 = 5,2

China: (3+3+1+7+1)/5 = 3

SEA: (1+7+7)/3 = 5

SA: (7+5+4)/3 = 5,33

When considering placements with more than one team at the same tier, all were considered the highest spot, so 13 was the lowest possible placement for majors, and 7th for minors.

**Ranking for Majors:**

EU&gt;China&gt;SEA&gt;CIS&gt;NA&gt;SA

**Ranking for Minors:**

CIS&gt;China&gt;NA=SEA&gt;EU&gt;SA

**Compared to the next Major &amp; Minor invites:**

Disneyland got 3 EU slots. Completely fair, they're the best on average. 3 China is also fair, they're the second best on average. But somehow, NA, the second worst region on average, gets 3 slots as well?

Same story with the minor. China getting 2 slots is fair, but EU, the second worst performing region in minors on average, gets 2 slots?

NA's major slot should go to SEA and EU's minor slot should go to CIS.

If you want to complain that outliers like VP affect the average too much, that's fine.",DotA2
28,A message to players in lower brackets,"Supports

Please stop blocking the first wave on the safelane. The enemy creeps end up under tower and the lane equilibrium is fucked, and a level 1 core can't farm them. Stop drawing aggro from creeps by harrassing the enemy if they're solo. The lane will push and they'll get exp and farm under the safety of their tower, or close to it, that they shouldn't. Stop hanging around the lane if your core can manage it on their own. Pull creeps if the lane gets pushed in.

I know practically nobody plays this role as a choice in this bracket, but when you do play it, do it right. These things make a lot of difference and they matter.

Everyone, stop taking the courier from mid when they need it. Manage your resources such that you won't. Take a close look at the side-shop, don't ever buy those items at the start of the game or bring them on the courier, unless you really can't visit the thing.  The mid's courier usage is the most important at this stage in the game. It's a 1v1 and whoever wins it will set the pace of the game until the main core farms up. This is extremely important to understand. Roam mid if you can actually do something, but don't go there on your Pudge to steal exp and c/s a bunch of creeps.

Cores, stop farming jungle for no reason. Lanes need pushing, towers need defending. The only scenario where you should farm jungle is if it's unsafe to do anything else on the map. The moment  that one hero that kills you shows on the map, go straight to a different lane and push it/farm it/pressure it into their towers. This will elicit a response from the enemy team, they'll have to rotate heroes to defend and that will open up space for you to farm elsewhere.

Stop using your TPs stupidly. They have a very long cooldown. You want to get the most value out of your TP, so using it to place yourself somewhere you could have simply walked is a really dumb idea. A TP can function as freedom of choice. You can either do this, or that. But if you use it for nothing, the choice is gone. You're now stuck to where you TP-ed for 80 seconds. It's either that or walk right back to where you TP-ed from, either case means wasted time and opportunities. Having it off-cooldown means you can be instantly active when and where it matters.",DotA2
32,Who is your favorite hero you suck at?,"Had a good discussion in my DotA chat group, curious to hear your answers.

Who is a hero you love playing, but generally lose games with?

Mine is dark seer. He's so much fun, but I am dreadful. 38% WR in ~100 games. Vacuum into wall is so much fun, however losing my ancient is not. 

How about you?

I've also encountered an issue where the app is extremely laggy. Like, 3 FPS laggy. This only happens on the predictions page, and only started after the OGA Minor matches were added. I assume this is because the app has too many matches loaded at once but my phone isn't lightweight, it should definitely be able to handle the work.

&amp;nbsp;

But, this thread not about this particular smurfers or whatever term is right there. And since I remember that there is no right place other than Reddit to ask Valve something, I just wanna ask a single question one more time ‚Äî **When Valve will provide us a tool to report blatant game ruiners?**. 


There is only 3 steps needed:

1. Mark people who got reported in same **ranked** match by **8+ different** players from both sides.

2. After 3-5 successful marks **per month** (or three months, whatever feels right) check marked players and initiate checking their matches for ""unusual activity"".

3. ""Unusual activity"" could include several tests like:

 - swings in KDA, GPM, XPM, (maybe APM if this is so important).

 - some keywords in allchat/teammates chat.

 - some rare checks like number of courier kills (5+), time of first blood and number of heroes participated in it.

&amp;nbsp;

You may say that this system would have multiple false positive alarms &gt;!like Gosu.AI!&lt; when people would report Arteezy or Bulldog just for fun, but recheck all 3 points above and you'll see that this would happen in far less than 0.5% of matches. Considering number of reports available per week and number of Venoms in this game number of false positives would be even less. 
&gt;!Plot twist: Valve will remove Random Draft from MMR search!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**tldr:** two friends somehow abusing game search ruining other people's game and noone can prevent this since reporting system doesn't work. Or probably I'm to impatient and can't wait for new reliability system.

It could be a feature for the few, if any, that have all of the hero relics for every hero already. However, it's much more likely a flaw that was overlooked. Should DotA still have that as an option? Wouldn't it be better if a notification popped-up and warned ""You have already collected all the available relics for this hero.

86,"Scandal in CIS community: Kodos, Team Empire midlaner accused of cheating in the Major Qualifiers finals","I haven't seen any posts on it yet, however the topic is pretty contraversial. 

# What happened? 

It started with the CIS caster and analyst PGG claiming that he [noticed the signs of cheating](https://clips.twitch.tv/CautiousCrepuscularLemur4Head) in the Team Empire - Na'Vi match. He claimed that Kodos, the midlaner of Team Empire, used cheating software to block the creeps because of too much APM and the ""suspitious black line"" next to the cursor. Team Empire manager Korben and CIS caster 4ce argued PGGs claim. 

V1lat asked pro players and analysts to check out the moment of blocking creeps in more details, and he described the overall reaction as  ""Almost ideal blocking, which currently can be seen only from Open AI bots""

# Further suspitions:

After the hype was brought up, CIS community noticed other moments, which at least require a closer look. 

1) [Euls on Axe on T2 tower](https://youtu.be/01o2CJNnYm8)

2) [Item Drop in the side shop](https://youtu.be/Mq-pOBSRQng)

I don't want to accuse anyone too early and I think it definetely requires an investigation , I'll just leave those clips for you to decide whether cheating took place their or not. 

# Media Reaction

Ilya ""Illidan"" Pivcaev about the creep block - ""it is a regular bind you can set up in 2 seconds, it is not APM or something forbidden. 

Nikita ""4ce"" Kotkov claimed that Kodos clicked Euls on Axe before he jumped, so when the distance got broken by Axe's blink, the Eul got activated

Artem ""fng"" Barshak (Gambit Captain) - said that ""they may face some problems"" but did not say anything particular

Yaroslav ""NS' Kuznetcov (CIS analyst) - ""this black line next to tha cursor is a replay bug. I don't have it, and cheating software does notaffect the replay. Secondly, the guy spent a ton of time training the creep block, and that is not ht eonly thing he is good at in game""

Dmitriy ""Korben"" Belov (Empire manager) - ""Our whole office is laughing. Thanks for hyping on this topic and raising our midlaners self-esteem""

Georgy DrAmer Faleev (Vega Sports Director) called PGG the ""king of 322"" and said that ""Instead of accusing young talents of cheating, PGG should speak out about his oun past performance as a player"". Without firther proof, DrAmer said that he heard from more that 10 people of how corrupted the StarSeries was at some point and how PGG was directly involved in it. ""The worst"", he sais"" is that the big names in CIS Dota are aware of that past of CIS community, and would follow the hate towards Kodos, instead of looking at their own mistakes in the past""

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? It is clear that there is no chating for you, or you think it definetely requires more attention from MDL and Valve?

108,"With the return of Ana, are OG back? Sujoy's recap video on the Paris Major EU quals","Hello again Dota fans. I had some mixed responses from previous recap videos so I‚Äôve tried really hard to take on board your feedback with this one. I‚Äôve made a video looking at OG‚Äôs performance in the MDL Disneyland Paris Major closed qualifiers, and their match-ups with Secret, Liquid and TFT. With Ana returning, there was always going to be a lot of scrutiny over the team and whether they can gel again. And would Ana be able to compete at this level after a 4-month break from the team?

Yes I called the video ‚ÄúOG:Back in a Major way‚Äù, and maybe some people will think it‚Äôs too soon to say they‚Äôre back. But I think I saw some signs of a return to form from the green team, and I‚Äôm checking now to see where I can buy a shirt to show my support in Paris.

Let me know what you think of the video and again I really appreciate the feedback and I take all comments on board for the next one.

113,"Hero concept: Obsidian Destroyer, Forgemaster of Aziyog","**INTRODUCTION**

**Obsidian Destroyer, Forgemaster of Aziyog** is a melee strength hero who lives  deep below the surface of the world lay unknown wonders and horrors. Down and down again, well beneath the slithering magma fields and simmering roots of dormant volcanoes stands the obsidian city of Aziyog, its incomparable stonework spanning an endless cavern. Within honeycomb walls mortared with the bones of countless slaves lies the domain of the Abyssal Horde, and their monstrous golem forgemaster.

___


- Creator of Abyssal Blade

- Rumor has it that Obsidian Destroyer was responsible of Petrified City of Saraddel

- Some people might feel like the name is familiar

- Best friends forever with Underlord

- Is he destroyer made from obsidian or destroying obsidian?

- Has a second job as an outhouse decorator

- Main lore inspirations: https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Abyssal_Blade/Lore https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Petrified_City_of_Saraddel https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Underlord/Lore

INT: 20 + 2.0

Movement speed: 290

Starting armor: 4

Starting damage: 60

___
**Q - MAGMA TORRENT**

*Obsidian Destroyer smashes the ground causing a rising magma torrent that, after a delay, knockbacks enemies, sends them into the air and deals magical damage.*

Closest comparison  is Kunkka's Torrent. This one displaces the enemy though. Would likely have a bigger delay than Kunkka. Knockback direction would be vector targeted.

Damage: 90/160/230/300

Knockback: 500 units

Disable duration: 1.0 second

Cast range: 1100

Cooldown: 30/25/20/15

Mana: 100
___

**W - UNSTOPPABLE FORCE**

*Hard obsidian armor protects Obsidian Destroyer, causing him to become spell immune and gain damage block for a short duration.*

Damage block: 30/50/70/90

Duration: 5 seconds

Cooldown: 24/22/20/18

Mana: 60
___

**E - OVERWHELMING BASH**

*Obsidian Destroyer swings his hammer, stunning an enemy and dealing extra damage.*

Works like Doom's Infernal Blade.

Damage: Attack damage + 100/125/150/175

Bash Duration: 1.5 seconds

Cooldown: 17/14/11/8

Mana: 50
___

**R - SHARDS OF DESTRUCTION**

*Obsidian Destroyer channels summoning a field of sharp obsidian shards around himself which slows enemies. Once the channel ends the shards erupt causing damage to enemies depending on the length of channel.*

Max channel time: 4 seconds

Max damage: 800/1100/1400

Radius: 900

Slow: 25%

Cooldown: 100/90/80

Mana: 150/200/250
___


**TALENTS**

Level 10: +5 armor OR 20 movement speed

Level 15: +125 Overwhelming Bash damage OR +1.5 seconds Unstoppable force duration

Level 20: +500 units Magma Torrent knockback  OR 25 health regen

Level 25:  30 strength OR +4 seconds Shards of Destruction max channel time (increases damage)


___

**GAMEPLAY PATTERN**

Durable and immobile crowd control hero suffering from somewhat long cooldowns and slow farming. Likes to build tanky auras. Could use Rod of Atos to set up Magma Torrent.

Spell combination: 

Use Unstoppable Force to run at enemy without resistance. Overwhelming Bash them. Then use Magma Torrent trying to predict where enemy will escape and immediately after start channeling your ultimate, Shards of Destruction. Hopefully Magma Torrent hits and sends enemy towards you allowing for a longer channeled ultimate before enemy escapes.

Another combination:

Gap close using Magma Torrent, then Overwhelming Bash them and start channeling ult. Unstoppable Force allows you to channel ultimate without interruption.



___

**APPEARANCE**

Spiky, bulky golem wielding a massive forgehammer.

Quick copypaste concept images from a google search: https://i.imgur.com/r8s1z8I.jpg

Alternatively do something else to distinguish him more from being a black Tiny. Could be more monstrous like Underlord, sleek alien type like Outworld Devourer or use more Smithing references.

1. If I first press Q, it will execute the skill but if I double press it or press the 2nd time, it will cancel it. So you don't have to press S. Same as to W,E,and,D. There is an alias for this I think.
2. If I press A, it will attack automatically on the ground like a hotkey, don't have to press leftmousebutton and attack nearest hero or enemy in the mouse pointer. It should work like a  hotkey so you dont have to keep pressing leftmousebutton. Or if this is not possible, just make it same like my rightmouseclickbutton/same value for my ""A"" key and ""Rightmouseclick"" button. I'm using force attack too.
3. Make my tp key a hotkey. Since the new patch, there is a new tp key for tp in the 7th slot. Can you make it a hotkey. My key for tp is ""V"".

The hero is so tilting for enemy... and the problem is that no one is playin to counter him... i mean, in pickin phase if they go for oracle and some strong carry u are thinking about countering the core, u dont give a shit ab oracle pick, and end up losing cuz u ignored him.

143,Signups for Redditors Dota 2 League EU Season 17 are now open!,"RD2L is kicking off its 17th Season! Season 17 runs from mid April until late June, with signups ending on April 13th.

**What is RD2L?**
--------------

The Redditors' Dota 2 League (RD2L) is a casual and competitive league for individual players (not teams) of all skill levels. It's a great way to experience organized and competitive Dota 2 without the heavy time commitments and scheduling uncertainty involved in forming a team for a typical league.

You can sign up as either a captain or a player. All players are placed in a draft pool from which captains will pick to form teams. You‚Äôll likely be placed with a team of people you haven‚Äôt met before, and will have the chance to make new friends as you practice and play together. After teams are drafted, they will play a 6 week group stage with one Captains Mode BO2 series each week, ending in a playoff for the top teams of each division.

  

**Why Play RD2L?**
--------------
   
*  **All skill levels welcome!** - While the average MMR in RD2L is high 3k - low 4k, we have players from 1k - 6k in the league. More experienced players can improve their teamwork, communication, and leadership skills while helping the lower MMR players improve their game skills.
*  **Balanced matches** - By drafting teams (similar to fantasy football), teams tend to be generally even in overall player skill. Additionally, regular season matchmaking pits teams with similar records up against each other each week to avoid unbalanced matchups.
* **A great way to build a stack** - Through inhouses and regular season matches, build a group of friends to stack and queue with. Teams made up of RD2L players regularly play in Battle Cups, AD2L, Valve Event Qualifiers and other events.
* **Develop your captaining and leadership skills** - Whether you captain this season or are mentored by one, RD2L is a great place to improve at CM. Drafting, strategy, and team play are all much more important than your average ranked pub game.
* **Make new friends** - We have hundreds of players each season, which means that you‚Äôll have a chance to meet people looking to have fun in a competitive setting like you. If you‚Äôre looking to meet more people to play Dota with this is a great league to get started in.
* **No scheduling hassles** - In our league you sign up for a division that plays its games on the same night every week. You‚Äôll know what night you need to play and won‚Äôt be scrambling to coordinate a match with your opponents.

**Signing up**
--------------
[Captain and Player Sign-Ups](https://eu.rd2l.gg/signup) and Information: For full information on how to sign up and rule changes from our previous season, see this post on our subreddit.


Captains get to draft players and run their team. If you wish to captain and this is your first season, you must be Legend or above and you must be approved by an admin vouch.

Players sign up to be drafted into a team. To sign up as a player you must have played at least 500 games and have 250 wins. Your Steam profile / Dota match data  must also be public to successfully sign up, and you are expected to keep it public for the duration of the season. There is no minimum MMR for players.

Sign-ups work on a first come first serve basis. The number of players we can support each season is limited by the number of captains that sign up, so being a captain is the best way to ensure you get a spot. (However, we typically ask for volunteers from returning players and previous captains if more are needed after sign-ups end, so don't feel pressure to sign-up as a captain.) If, as a player, you go undrafted, you can still be added to a team that needs you during the season as a Free Agent.

In Season 17, the Wednesday division will continue with 6-player teams, while the Sunday division will, for the first time, have teams consisting of 5 players (1 captain + 4 drafted players).

If you're having signup issues, you can send us a modmail on our subreddit, PM me here on reddit, or come to [our discord](https://discord.gg/6nVQ2QT) and ask an administrator for assistance there.

**Season 17 Schedule**
--------------


 | WED | SUN
|---|---|---
Draft Day | April 17th | April 21st
Group Stage | April 24th - May 29th | April 28th - June 2nd
Playoffs (Top 8 Teams)| June 5th - June 19th | June 9th - June 16th
Playoffs might be extended by one week (Top 16 teams), depending on number of signups. 




**Divisions**
--------------
When you sign up, you will choose a division for a day/time where you'll be regularly available. For the entire regular season, your matches will start at the same time on the same night of the week! For example, the CET-SUN division plays every Sunday on Luxembourg Servers at 19:30 CET.

Divisions list:

Match Time | Server | Days
----------|:------:|----
20:30 CEST | EU West | Wednesday
19:30 CEST | EU West | Sunday



You may sign up for both CET-Wednesday and CET-Sunday if you wish. Please be aware that signing up for multiple divisions is not an invitation to pick one that you prefer and quit the other - quitting an RD2L team typically results in expulsion from the league.

Communication will be done via discord only. If you have any questions, you can always send me a PM via reddit or find me in Discord and PM me there. Our discord is full of active and friendly community members that can help with any confusion.

Thanks, we hope you enjoy the season.

2 slots for SA is also too much I think. 1 is enough to encourage the region.

Give these extra slots to the region who is doing well.

183,What's going on with the DPC standings?,"*TL, DR: Someone needs to be in better control of the official DPC standings and clarify some of the rules because right now it's confusing and unprofessional especially for teams possibly fighting for the last few spots to TI and we should not have to risk arguing the exact standings after all tournaments have been played.*

Checking out the DPC standings after the surprise qualifications of TEAM TEAM, complexity, Team Empire and Pain Gaming to the Disneyland Paris Major there are some things about the way DPC points are handled I personally find deeply unprofessional and would like to discuss.

First and foremost, the fact that the DPC standings on Liquipedia and especially the official site are not properly updated for all teams is a big problem. Last year with dozens of tournaments, I could kind of understand but this year, there really is no excuse. Some examples:

* Thunder Predator has 150 points on Liquipedia and (correctly) 120 on the official site. **1-0 Valve**

* Test123 is still at 120 points on Liquipedia but since they were PainX when they got those points and points stay with organizations, the official site has removed them. **2-0 Valve**

* Old but Gold has 90 points on the official site but there was no third place decider in that tournament and both them and Flying Penguins got 80 points as Liquipedia says. **2-1 Valve**

* Flying Penguins got 80 points but released three players in mid march and another five players (disband) on March 23rd. Since even a disband theoretically doesn't remove all points (it seems to be always calculated by 20% of the remaining total per player), I'm not even sure about the math here but my calculator says getting 80 points and removing seven players results in 16,777 points. Who knew? Valve has them at 22, Liquipedia at 51,2. **2-1-1 Valve**

* If Flying Penguins is in, why was PainX removed and isn't sitting on 49,152 points? **2-1-2 Draw**

* Team Tigers won 120 points by winning the first freaking Minor and then dropped four players over the season. For some reason, they are not on the official leaderboard. Liquipedia has them on 61,44 points for three removals. Since only three point-winning players were replaced (but a fourth in Mushi added and then removed without adding points to the team), it's unclear to me whether this or my personal calculation of 49,152 points is correct. **2-1-2-1 Draw**

* RNG took 54 points (90 with sub), then replaced 343 with September. They then played with Flyby and Mad for Setsu and September for a while, didn't take any points but qualified with that squad to the Starladder Minor. Again unclear, whether this should be penalized and if so how heavily since only Setsu was in the point-winning squad at the time. To the Starladder Minor they showed up with Lanm instead of Mad and took 20 points. Was Lanm a third replacement? Was he a sub? Both? Liquipedia has them on 54,56 points, Valve at 43. Since I'm a hardliner I put them on 31,7184 points but don't even ask me how I got there. **2-1-2-2 Draw**

* Playmakers Esports/Team Odd/Demolition Boys: I have already spend 2 hours on this post. They switched players, switched orgs, took some points. Who the fuck knows. Valve puts them at 19 points, Liquipedia at 52,8. My experience after looking into this for a while makes me think both these numbers are wrong. **2-1-2-3 Who knows**

* TEAM TEAM took 40 points but has since replaced Ryoya and Sammyboy with EE and Gunnar. They should be at 25,6 points but Liquipedia says 40 and the official site doesn't list them at all. **2-1-3-3 Everybody loses**

* ROONS and Vega and possibly others are also unclear but I think I made my point

In conclusion, Valve should clean up this mess. Someone should remember to update the standings of all points holders after at least every official Valve sponsored event. Also, the rules should be much clearer and accessible to everyone on their homepage (i.e. in the at this point ridiculously short and unclear FAQ section). I'm sure I could have found more information on it and I'm 99% positive I made mistakes in my calculations or understanding on how the whole system works but that is kind of the point: 

The whole DPC system is completely byzantine right now and I didn't even go into the whole sub thing (Miracle-shadow), visa issues and whether or not the power of organizations has become too great to the point that they could blackmail players with their DPC points and/or sit out half the season without much consequence so long as they pick up a good squad that is going to the last Major (a la mouz historically or currently Pain).

I know Valve has a more ""we will deal with it if it becomes a problem"" approach so maybe I should just take a chill pill. Considering the money on the line though, I feel it's kind of wrong to leave these questions unanswered for now and deal with it later. And before you rush to the conclusion that I'm insane and a few points are completely meaningless, look at this current scenario: TEAM TEAM is going to Disneyland, EHOME (12th) isn't. Let's assume EHOME doesn't make it to the Minor either and TEAM TEAM scores a surprising 7th/8th. According to Valve, EHOME would be 12th on 489 points and tt 13th on 450. Liquipedia would put tt 12th with 490 points though. In reality, they'd be sitting on 475,6.

Now imagine a similar scenario at the last Major and with a constellation involving RNG or Demolition Boys.",DotA2

185,Game-throwing bug with gem and courier,"Hey there everyone

So i was watching this game where the lion had bought a gem + 2 other items and tried to deliver it on a courier which already had 4 of its slots occupied, the exact second the courier tried to take the items from this lion's stash it picked up the 2 other items (which were consumables, wards and a tome of xp) and insta-delivered the gem to the place lion was at because (i think) it prioritized the consumables over gem and since gem can't be put into backpack it just got insta-delivered to lion, here's the [dotabuff](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/4605248822) link for the match and the match id is **4605248822**, time stamps for all this are min 30:06 when lion bought the items and min 30:35 when the courier tries to deliver the items.

I'm sure this bug has also happened to me as well and i think it might've been already reported on reddit too, hope someone at valve (the janitor) notices this and fixes it for the next patch because some players might not notice this and would just feed a gem for free and get fucked for it.",DotA2

189,Low FPS - should my computer's specs be getting better FPS than it is?,"Bear with me, because I'm terrible with computers. If I need to provide any more information, please let me know.


I've just started playing again and am having severe FPS issues. My fps has historically been 40-50, which I have no issue with. However, during a game I'm now 30-50, and during any kind of fight, it drops to 10-20 pretty consistently, which is unplayable for me. I play on the minimum possible graphics settings, with the suggested resolution (3860/2160 or something like that). I tried going to a lower resolution with the same minimum settings, and that shot my fps up to 100, but the entire game was blurry as all hell and unplayable.


I have a Toshiba laptop, 15in. Intel Core i7 6500u @ 2.50 gHz. 16gb RAM, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 950M. I truly have no idea, but shouldn't I be getting better than 10-20 fps during fights with this computer? What are some possible fixes - are there settings I can change, or should I have the fan cleaned out or something like that?

Too much toxic ppl who just want to ruin game,sellling wards feeding,in last 10 games i didnt had 2 completed games over half hour. Im just here to take some fun and couple of wins nothing special, even that isnt impossible in my case.

For sure im stopping ranked cuz this goes nowhere.

Is it just me or u have same problem?

202,Kaya Upgrade (Suggestion),"Let me try with my own suggestion. This item would be good for Pudge, KotL, and Vengeful (personally I hated when they made Magic Missile that slow)

Eloquent Arc Wand:

Kaya (2050) + Point Booster (1200) + Recipe (450)

Active: For 6 seconds, increases your spells projectile speed by 200.

Dispellable: Yes

208,DotA2 Pro Circuit App Bug (predictions and fantasy),"The app doesn't seem to function as intended and I need to predict at least 5 time for it to accept my predictions. Also, once I choose any one regional qualifier fantasy league players, the option/list to choose other regional qualifiers vanishes. This seems to be pretty broken and adding to the fact that my RTZ from MDL qualifiers is sitting at 0 points.

Any chance you guys have a workaround to these issues?",DotA2

210,Do you lose more MMR if you abandon over taking a normal loss?,"Specifically during calibration?

I was playing my solo calibration today and I lost power, resulting in an abandon.

I'm not worried about getting LP since I'm generally a well behaved player and I'm pretty sure my last abandon was like, about a year ago.

Just worried how much my MMR will tank.

#Notes:
~~I'm aware that ""Status Resistance Reduction"" is a horribly clunky phrase, but it's already in use for Enfeeble, so I went with it.~~ Arcane Supremacy uses the more clear ""Debuff Duration Amplification"" keyword; thanks to /u/weebAnnihilator [(source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/b8kmsz/_/ejzdrp4)

For clarity: the first time you cast a spell after using Caduceus, it deals 25% more damage (if it deals any) and its debuff lasts 25% longer (if it has any). **EDIT:** Additionally, because this wasn't clear from the original post, **Spell Amplification and Status Resistance Reduction values return to their passive values once the buff ends.** *This really only applies to spells that last for longer than 4 seconds, and I'm pretty sure that changes in Status Resistance do not alter the duration of already-applied Status Effects.*

Make no mistake; this is meant to be more of an upgrade to Ghost Scepter than an upgrade to Kaya.

I considered making this basically an Ethereal Blade that gives fewer stats, costs less, doesn't slow or damage on-hit, and reduces Status Resistance as well as Magic Damage Resistance when cast on enemies, but I felt that a cheaper E-Blade with built-in SpellAmp might be a bit much (not that I'm convinced *this* is perfectly-balanced, either).

To be honest, it kinda feels like Ethereal forms should already amplify status effects on their own; I always liked the lore-as-mechanic aspect of physical beings having a base level of magic resistance, and of having to give up that innate resistance to remove yourself from the physical realm‚Äîand, in so doing, remove yourself also from the threat of physical harm. It feels like a natural extension of that reasoning to also say that spells' effects will linger for a longer time.... but then again, I hated that experiment with Brewmaster and ""elemental damage"", so maybe it's for the best.

Here's an [alternate icon](https://i.imgur.com/OE4I3Vs.png) that attempts to reference Ghost Scepter more in its design; I didn't like this one as much, as it felt too cluttered (and the icons are displayed at half their size in-game, so the wisps of... ectoplasm? coming out of the snakes' eyes would be almost impossible to see).",DotA2

230,"Scandal in CIS community: Kodos, Team Empire midlaner accused of cheating in the Major Qualifiers finals","I haven't seen any posts on it yet, however the topic is pretty contraversial. 

# What happened? 

It started with the CIS caster and analyst PGG claiming that he [noticed the signs of cheating](https://clips.twitch.tv/CautiousCrepuscularLemur4Head) in the Team Empire - Na'Vi match. He claimed that Kodos, the midlaner of Team Empire, used cheating software to block the creeps because of too much APM and the ""suspitious black line"" next to the cursor. Team Empire manager Korben and CIS caster 4ce argued PGGs claim. 

V1lat asked pro players and analysts to check out the moment of blocking creeps in more details, and he described the overall reaction as  ""Almost ideal blocking, which currently can be seen only from Open AI bots""

# Further suspitions:

After the hype was brought up, CIS community noticed other moments, which at least require a closer look. 

1) No aim Euls

*Processing video 01ygprrgl3q21...*

2) Item Drop 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing video kj847gsnl3q21...*

I don't want to accuse anyone too early and I think it definetely requires an investigation , I'll just leave those clips for you to decide whether cheating took place their or not. 

# Media Reaction

Ilya ""Illidan"" Pivcaev about the creep block - ""it is a regular bind you can set up in 2 seconds, it is not APM or something forbidden. 

Nikita ""4ce"" Kotkov claimed that Kodos clicked Euls on Axe before he jumped, so when the distance got broken by Axe's blink, the Eul got activated

Artem ""fng"" Barshak (Gambit Captain) - said that ""they may face some problems"" but did not say anything particular

Yaroslav ""NS' Kuznetcov (CIS analyst) - ""this black line next to tha cursor is a replay bug. I don't have it, and cheating software does notaffect the replay. Secondly, the guy spent a ton of time training the creep block, and that is not ht eonly thing he is good at in game""

Dmitriy ""Korben"" Belov (Empire manager) - ""Our whole office is laughing. Thanks for hyping on this topic and raising our midlaners self-esteem""

Georgy DrAmer Faleev (Vega Sports Director) called PGG the ""king of 322"" and said that ""Instead of accusing young talents of cheating, PGG should speak out about his oun past performance as a player"". Without firther proof, DrAmer said that he heard from more that 10 people of how corrupted the StarSeries was at some point and how PGG was directly involved in it. ""The worst"", he sais"" is that the big names in CIS Dota are aware of that past of CIS community, and would follow the hate towards Kodos, instead of looking at their own mistakes in the past""

&amp;#x200B;

I mute all the gamer ruiners and players who are either really bad or so toxic they are purposely ruining the game for the team.

&amp;#x200B;

A large portion of my games contain 1-3 pre muted players. Obviously rare occasions no pre mutes, or maybe even 4 pre mutes.

  
The thing I've noticed the MOST is that they are always on my team. Everytime I see 3 pre mutes, they all happen to be on my team. I'm curious how that is even remotely fair. Valve needs a system like overwatch where you have an option to ""Avoid this player"". So if I have avoid this player set to 3 of my teammates maybe only give me one of those idiots and not all 3.

293,About the GSL Format,"First, a rant about GSL. If you lose your first series, there's no way you can top your group. Also if Team A beats Team C in their first series, loses against Team B (that won vs D), and then loses against Team C (that won vs D), they get placed lower than Team C despite being 1-1 h2h with team C. 

The 1-2 and 2-3 seeding matters quite a bit because in the first case, it could be the difference between facing Secret and a lesser team in upper bracket. In the second case, it could mean getting sent to the lower bracket for a Bo1 elimination because you lost the second series and won the first instead of the other way round.

Why is it that we don't see round-robin to truly gauge the seeding of the teams? It only takes one more series per group (of 4) with h2h as tiebreaker. Since they are held simultaneously, it extends the day by about 3h for a 2-1 series, and you could play 3 series a day over 2 or 4 days depending on how many groups you wanna run simultaneously.

I can understand the need for such formats due to time constraints but 6 vs 5 series isn't much of a difference to justify a shitty format.",DotA2

326,Immortal Rank Meta Trends - a week into 7.21d,"Spectral guy here. Yet another first-week-report. There is also NADCL Season 3 post in works. Not sure about major qualifiers, let me know if you're interested.

This post is based on data collected during the first week of patch 7.21d. This report includes not only ranked data, but stats of all matches with average rank equal to Immortal. Excluded matches are the ones that had abandons, ended in less than 10 minutes or had insignificantly low score (or it was impossible to get detailed draft data for them).

Positions data may be inaccurate in some way (mostly so that very bad core games are counted as support while supports who had high stats and didn't spent much on support items may be considered core), but it's most likely to be insignificant.

There's something off about draft stages at the moment, just ignore it for now.

[Full report is available here](https://spectralalliance.ru/reports/?league=imm_ranked_721d). You can look through data by yourself if you want, maybe you'll find something interesting as well. There are more detailed data about Hero VS Hero performance, Draft stages priorities, pairs and trios, positions stats and dire/radiant winrates, Meta Graph and region specific data. The report will be updated semi-weekly (sort of).

# Short FAQ

* **Why so little matches played in REGION NAME?** On higher ranks it's common to queue for game on closest popular region. I.e. EUW for RU players, USE for USW.
* **Where did you get data?** I've got match IDs manually extracted from leaderboards players' recent matches using STRATZ API. Then I fetch match data using mostly OpenDota API.
* **Why there are only random draft matches played in China?** They just like playing random draft ever since DotA All-Stars days.
* **What does banned winrate mean?** It's winrate of a player (and his team) who nominated a hero for ban.
* **Can I see individual players stats somewhere?** Techically - yes. But there are too much players, reports are getting too big and unreadable because of that. Also privacy stuff.
* **What is Hero Pairs Divergence?** It's the difference between expected pair's matches and real match number. Usually this difference is higher for better hero combos.
* **What is Hero Rank?** Think of it as of smart winrate sort. It considers popularity and winrate of heroes.
* **Is it strictly Immortal Rank?** Not for now, there may be some random individual divine players here and there. Altho, an ""Immortal Rank"" match is usually the match with at least 9 immortal players in it.

# Summary

346,Spell Amplification Mechanics,"I've been playing Pangolier and noticed that Swashbuckle isn't scalable with spell amplification while it's obviously a spell. So i decided to look through some abilities that might have had some or at least i had questions about. Basically i checked if ALT+MOUSE would show some difference. Some of abilities are amplified, but the damage isn't shown(so it needs to be shown).

After all it IS NOT a ""let's amplify everything i mentioned"" suggestion post, but a CLARIFICATION one.

ABADDON's APHOTIC SHIELD doesn't scale dmg.

CENTAUR's passive ATTACK DURATION is scalable(you can increase duration of a spell, yeah).

KUNKKA's  TIDEBRINGER BONUS DAMAGE isn't scalable.

NIGHT STALKER's ultimate's BONUS DAMAGE isn't scalable.

TIDEHUNTER's ANCHOR SMASH DAMAGE REDUCTION is scalable(with talent and K&amp;S you can make 99.53% dmg reduction).

ANTIMAGE's passive isn't scalable.

BOUNTY HUNTER's JINADA BONUS DAMAGE isn't scalable.

BROOD MOTHER's ultimate BONUS DAMAGE isn't scalable.

DROW RANGER's ultimate PROC DAMAGE isn't scalable.

MEDUSA's SPLIT SHOT isn't scalable.

MONKEY KING's passive BONUS DAMAGE isn't scalable.

NYX ASSASSIN's MANA BURN int into dmg ins't scalable (even though riki's agi into damage is scalable).

PANGOLIER's SWASHBUCKLE isn't scalable.

RAZOR's passive isn't scalable(and cooldown on passive can not be lowered with octarine).

TEMPLAR ASSASSIN's TRAP DAMAGE isn't scalable.

TERRORBLADE's METAMORPHOSIS BONUS DAMAGE isn't scalable.

ANCIENT APPARITION's CHILLING TOUCH DAMAGE isn't scalable.

CHEN's DIVINE FAVOR BONUS DAMAGE isn't scalable.

LICH's FROST SHIELD DAMAGE isn't scalable.

PUGNA's WARD's dmg per mana isn't scalable.

4.When are the power spikes when I should go online and teamfight(other than the necesarry teleports into mid teamfights and picking off low hp heroes)?

381,"Piece Discussion of the Day: Pawn (April 1st, 2019)","##**Pawn**

The pawn (‚ôô,‚ôü) is the most numerous [piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece) in the game of [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess), and in most circumstances, also the weakest. It historically represents [infantry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry), or more particularly, armed [peasants](/r/leagueoflegends) or [pikemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikemen). Each player begins a game with eight pawns, one on each square of the [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#rank) immediately in front of the other pieces. (The white pawns start on a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2; the black pawns start on a7, b7, c7, d7. e7, f7, g7, h7.)

Individual pawns are referred to by the [file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#file) on which they stand. For example, one speaks of ""White's f-pawn"" or ""Black's b-pawn"". Alternatively, they can be referred to by the piece which stood on that file at the beginning of the game, e.g. ""White's king bishop's pawn"" or ""Black's queen knight's pawn"". It is also common to refer to a [rook's pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#rook's_pawn), meaning any pawn on the a- or h-files, a [knight's pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#knight's_pawn) (on the b- or g-files), a [bishop's pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#bishop's_pawn) (on the c- or f-files), a [queen's pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#queen's_pawn) (on the d-file), a [king's pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#king's_pawn) (on the e-file), and a [central pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#central_pawn) (on the d- or e-files).

_The pawn is the soul of chess. ... the Pawns. They are the very Life of the Game. They alone form the Attack and the Defense; on their good or bad Situation depends the Gain or Loss of the Party. - [Fran√ßois-Andr√© Danican Philidor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-Andr%C3%A9_Danican_Philidor)_

---

##**Roles:** Infantry

##**Movement**

Pawns move differently than other pieces. Unlike all the other pieces, pawns can not move backwards. Most of the time, a pawn moves by going up a single square, but the first time each pawn is moved from its starting place, it can go forward two squares. Pawns may not use the first two-square move to jump over a square with another piece on it or to capture. Any piece in front of a pawn, white or black, stops its moving.

**Capturing**

Unlike other pieces, the pawn does not capture in the same direction that it moves. A pawn captures diagonally forward one square to the left or right.

Another unusual rule is the [en passant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant) capture. It can occur after a pawn advances two squares using its initial two-step move option, and the square passed over is attacked by an enemy pawn. The enemy pawn is entitled to capture the moved pawn ""in passing"" ‚Äì as if it had advanced only one square. The capturing pawn moves to the square over which the moved pawn passed (see diagram), and the moved pawn is removed from the board. The option to capture the moved pawn en passant must be exercised on the move immediately following the double-step pawn advance, or it is lost for the remainder of the game.

En passant was added in the 15th century to compensate for the then newly added two-square initial move rule (Hooper &amp; Whyld 1992:124). Without en passant, a pawn on its initial square could safely bypass a square controlled by an advanced enemy pawn.

**Promotion**

A pawn that advances all the way to the opposite side of the board (the opposing player's first rank) is [promoted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(chess\)) to another piece of that player's choice: a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. The pawn is immediately (before the opponent's next move) replaced by the new piece. Since it is uncommon for a piece other than a queen to be chosen, promotion is often called ""queening"". When some other piece is chosen it is known as [underpromotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underpromotion). The piece most often selected for underpromotion is a [knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_(chess\)), used to execute a [checkmate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkmate) or a [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(chess\)) to gain a significant net increase in material. Underpromotion is also used in situations where promoting to a queen would give immediate [stalemate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalemate). The choice of promotion is not limited to pieces that have been captured; thus a player could in theory have as many as ten knights, ten bishops, ten rooks or nine queens on the board simultaneously. While this extreme would almost never occur in practice, in game 11 of their 1927 world championship match, [Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ra%C3%BAl_Capablanca) and [Alexander Alekhine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Alekhine) each had two queens in play from move 65 through move 66. While some finer sets do include an extra queen of each color, most standard chess sets do not come with additional pieces, so the physical piece used to replace a promoted pawn on the board is usually one that was previously captured. When the correct piece is not available, some substitute is used: a second queen is often indicated by inverting a previously captured rook, or a piece is borrowed from another set.

##**Strategy**

**Isolated pawn**

Pawns on adjacent files can support each other in attack and defense. A pawn which has no friendly pawns in adjacent files is an [isolated pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_pawn). The square in front of an isolated pawn may become an enduring weakness. Any piece placed directly in front not only blocks the advance of that pawn, but cannot be driven away by other pawns.

**Passed pawn**

A pawn which cannot be blocked or captured by enemy pawns in its advance to promotion is a [passed pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passed_pawn). In the diagram, White has a protected passed pawn on c5 and Black has an outside passed pawn on h5. Because endgames are often won by the player who can promote a pawn first, having a passed pawn in an endgame can be decisive ‚Äì especially a protected passed pawn (a passed pawn that is protected by a pawn). In this vein, a pawn majority, a greater number of pawns belonging to one player on one side of the chessboard, is strategically important because it can often be converted into a passed pawn.

**Doubled pawn**

After a capture with a pawn, a player may end up with two pawns on the same file, called [doubled pawns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubled_pawns). Doubled pawns are substantially weaker than pawns which are side by side, because they cannot defend each other, they usually cannot both be defended by adjacent pawns, and the front pawn blocks the advance of the back one.

There are situations where doubled pawns confer some advantage, typically when the guarding of consecutive squares in a file by the pawns prevents an invasion by the opponent's pieces.

Pawns which are both doubled and isolated are typically a tangible weakness. A single piece or pawn in front of doubled isolated pawns blocks both of them, and cannot be easily dislodged. It is rare for a player to have three pawns in a file, i.e. tripled pawns.

**Wrong rook pawn**

In chess endgames with a bishop, a [rook pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#rook_pawn) may be the [wrong rook pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrong_rook_pawn), depending on the square-color of the bishop. This causes some positions to be draws that would otherwise be wins.

Usually my posts are about how techies is overpowered and its because i only tell the truth :p but today i ask for wisdom about a career in casting. 

Ive been playing dota for 6 and a half years now and have fell in love with the game,  community and lore and techies.

Ive played in competitve teams and am very familiar with how different dota is in this setting espicially around ti time.

Aswell as playing competitivly throughout my esporrs career first with call of duty and dota i started shoutcasting matches for a quick laugh, attempting to motivate the players up in my ranked games to play the game, eventually i got better and better and learnt shoutcasting techniques to apply to these short moments eventually (over the years) sounding more and more like the casters you hear today. 

Ive had a ton of people tell me they love my casting and alot more peoole saying i should become a caster 

Ive shoutcasted many scrims on my stream and also shoutcasted for dota lans but i cant seem to find the next step on how to pursue this dream. What do i do reddit,  its really hard to be seen. 

I need your help reddit as soon as possibly so i wont forget it, because as much as i enioy casting  i could never do it for ever lasting, as like everyone, we gotta pay the bills in order to live a little closer to holly wood hills

409,Why are people on this subreddit more worried about the pro scene or other meaningless fluff instead of their own gameplay in pubs?,"Is there a reason people constantly complain about which team qualified/didn't qualify, or how many slots each region deserves, or some meaningless drama in the pro scene?! Like I'm so tired of seeing 50 fucking posts about the same thing that happened with some team. Why aren't there more individual and diverse posts making it to the top? Every single post is always 50 different iterations of the same drama that is happening in the pro scene, or mediocre fan art, or some random twitch clip from a streamer. ",DotA2

417,01/04/2019 Piece Tier List,"Hey guys welcome back for another recent metagame review. As always, this is based on only the top professional matches - and given the importance of today with the Dubai Open starting, we had to quickly review the last month.

As we saw in the European Individual Championship (from Skopje), the US Chess Champion Ship (St. Louis, USA) &amp; Sharjah Masters (UEA) - it seems like Queen's remain the top piece-to-beat with 54.6% winrate after move 30 on both black &amp; white (insane factional statistics!).

In the still-ongoing  Vugar Gashimov Memorial Shamkir Tournament (live from Azerbaijan) we saw something interesting as the normalized pawn value decreased below 0.97 for the first time in 2 years of competitive events. Both Stockfish and Houdini initially felt there were inaccuracies being made but upon review (and with more processing time), they confirmed the valuation. The second-order pawn function also was at it's flattest in 6 years - but part of this is due to the low base values.

As we saw in the Tata Steel Chess Open, the **synergy** value of **double-Bishop** vs Bishop+Knight in the midgame proved to be too strong, +0.3 at the minimum and a whopping +0.64 average gain. **e4** made significant losses at the event, but when adjusting for Elo the effect was lessened (to within one error deviation).

&amp;#x200B;

Updated Tier List

1. King
2. Queen
3. Rook
4. Bishop
5. Knight
6. Pawn

421,Are Torte De Lini guides becoming worse?,"I used to be a great fan of Torte De Lini guides,but after Dota + came out and he went on a hiatus,the guides are actually way worse.Before,I used his guides and actually learned how to play the hero.He had comments on most abilities and items,but now even though I would buy an item because its in the guide,I dont know why its good for the hero(even after playing for 11 years) because of no tooltips on the item.Not only that,but some guides are even outdated(like for example the Razor Guide).",DotA2
422,"Jokes Aside, Chess is an amazing and fulfilling game. If you want to get better, or get into chess, try these links.","Hey all!

Im an avid dota 2 player and a USCF chess expert who frequents both the r/chess and r/dota 2 subreddit.

I know it's just an april fool's joke here, but this is bound to get people thinking about trying to play more chess.

While becoming really great at chess is difficult, it is surprisingly easy to learn enough about chess to feel like you're playing it ""correctly.""

For those of you trying to get better at chess, but don't want to spend money on 500 different books (like I did), there are plenty of youtube and twitch personalities that help players develop.

I recommend IM John Bartholomew. This is his youtube channel.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6hOVYvNn79Sl1Fc1vx2mYA/playlists

John is one of the most clear headed youtube personalities and he is very eloquent in his manner of explaining why he does things. 
I recommend watching his ""Chess Fundamentals"" play list, and then follow up with a few of his videos in the ""climbing the rating ladder"" video list.

Next time you're raging at dota 2 because your support didn't buy wards because your carry didn't see pudge rotate halfway across the map at minute 3, sit down and watch John explain chess.

The funny thing is that this guy had open mic and talked waaaaay too much, indian accent, and i can swear he was a psycho. Here why... he said "" i go ags first, for u void for u"" then he build radiance and said after radi goes ags, after radi went manta and said after... and so one... till he stared to take all farm, going mental, when me or fv tried to farm lane or jungle he stared to scream.. Like rly loud and i tought he is having a seizure, let him farm... he was BIPOLAR, after scream, he talked rly slow and apologised, was so forgiving, this behaviour repeting all game.
Anyway, from the strat till end, he was positive, even when we lost fights he said is ok is ok we win... at some point he started flaming fv for bad cronos and nigma... 
He was smth like this "" FUCK UUUUU, FUCK MEEEE, MEEE FUCK MEE"", apologised after and this lasted all the mid late game... 
I laughed all game.. Had tears in my eyes, rarely could do the ember combos... was super funny...
This was my last game for last badge on ember. Master Ember Spirit. Always be remembered.
Wanted to share with u guys.

451,Social media development for smaller teams,"Greetings, friends! April 1st is probably not the best day to post a semi-serious thread, but here-goes.

I'm about to graduate from college with a degree in visual communications (short for photo, video, graphic design and web design) and I need to beef up the graphic design portion of my portfolio. 

I could do the graphics on anything but I've always been very interested in dota teams and their branding on social media. I have experience in brand cohesiveness for myself and some friends that heavily use socials as well but would love to potentially help some smaller dota teams make their brands more concise. 

In today's scene, a strong visual presence online can make a huge difference in regard to cultivating a fanbase, and strong branding for social media outlets can help that process along.

Recent example of my work: https://imgur.com/a/DVGrsMT 

TL;DR: if you're part of or know of a smaller dota team that would like some new channel/social art, give me the name of the team, a link to any sort of social media the team has (or a leader), a little mission statement (if applicable), and what sort of art you're interested in (youtube art? twitter banners? facebook graphics? etc). And maybe consider throwing me an upvote so I can reach more people. Because you're going out on a limb to trust me, I obviously don't need to be paid. Getting work for my portfolio is enough for me and being able to say that an actual team uses my work is a major bonus, so it's in my best interest to make you happy and give you a product you're satisfied with. 

Thanks and have a great day.",DotA2

491,Stream Sniping and Blocking the Mini-Map,"Watching DotA streams on Twitch is something most of us have indulged in at some point. A lot of us regularly see streamers hide/cover their mini map owing to alleged stream sniping. As a viewer, my level of enjoyment and following the game goes down significantly when watching a game with a blocked mini-map versus not. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Why do streamers hide it in the first place?*   
The most common response you get from streamers and viewers is ""not having wards"". The most common mini-map overlay are the ones with most of the possible wards spots already in place and a translucent background to cover hero icons and wards. Streamers feel like stream sniping is solely the reason they might be losing the game and blocking the mini-map both deters people from &amp; combats stream-sniping. For people whose livelihood depends on streaming they will take the steps they deem necessary to win the games and make the stream more enjoyable. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Does it work?*  
Stream-sniping definitely exists, but probably not as rampant as a lot of streamers/viewers project it to be. The truth is, you can never really be sure if something in a game happened because of them sniping the stream or superior game sense. There are very few circumstances a streamer can absolutely be sure that the enemy team's actions are because of them streaming sniping the game.  

An example: Any non-cliff eye ward getting dewarded is more often than not attributed to stream sniping when the mini-map is not covered; and not to the enemy supports being competent at dewarding by either spotting/game sense/sentry spamming. 

Any person that has decided to stream snipe a game to gain an unfair advantage; will probably not stop simply because the streamer blocked the mini-map. He can still see the gameplay and/or hear their calls. The only reason why a sniper will stop is due to stream delays; which is usually the most common thing streamers do during tournament games. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Why not stream with a delay then?*

Because streamers think this takes away the ""live stream"" aspect of their product and reduces their interaction with their viewers/chat and makes it less friendly for viewers to continue watching. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Watching a stream with a blocked mini-map isn't the same as being able to see the mini-map.* 

As a viewer; my experience and enjoyment drastically goes down when the stream has a blocked mini-map. The mini-map gives way too much valuable information that helps you connect the dots and enhances the viewing experience exponentially. Being able to look at the mini-map; look at wards, allies' movements, enemies showing or not; are simply not substitutable. Hopping into a stream mid game is very different when the mini-map is blocked. Not being able to determine where the lanes are, how many towers are standing, wards, etc are all not ascertained by a viewer right away; but they are when they stream has an open mini-map. 

Streamers block their mini-map in order to give them a better chance to win so that viewers have more fun; but are directly crippling the viewer experience. Of course streams can still be enjoyed with a blocked mini-map; but there is absolutely no way the same stream will not be MORE enjoyable with the mini-map visible. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Does covering the mini-map actually work towards achieving its goal? You can never be sure if you're being stream sniped or not; with both a blocked and a visible mini-map. But blocking the mini-map surely does work towards lowering the viewing experience.**   


I have often bought this up in streams where the streamer blocks the mini-map. Loyal subs will usually respond by saying something along the lines of watching all your wards getting dewarded or losing the game is not very fun. Again, that can not be truly be ascertained or attributed to stream sniping; but decreased viewing experience is stating the obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

BSJ once said the reason he blocks the mini-map is coz you can never be sure why your smoke ganks are being caught or why you're being dewarded when the mini-map is visible; but you can be fairly sure it is not due to sniping when blocked.  It is a sense of uncertainty you have as to why your strategy is not working when the mini-map is not blocked; and that insecurity is nullified to some extent when they block the mini-map. 

&amp;#x200B;

When Matumbaman was asked by his chat why he won't block his mini-map he said the same thing this post is trying to. He said something like ""Watching a stream with a blocked mini-map is no fun. I will never watch one; so why will I expect yo guys to watch mine. A mini-map is essential in watching a dota stream"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Thats my two cents on the topic and I'm merely discussing the topic. People whose livelihood depends on their streams are welcome to do what they wish with their stream. My argument is that it decreases the viewing experience and makes me less likely to watch a stream with a blocked mini-map. Streamers ultimately stream for the viewers, and not to solely to win games. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR: Streamers blocking their mini-map due to (alleged) stream sniping drastically reduces their viewer's experience while not serving the purpose they do it for in the first place.**

514,I made a free Dota 2 tool and I think it's one the better tools available,"here is the link [https://www.dotavoyance.com/](https://www.dotavoyance.com/)

&amp;#x200B;

I recently added a neural network that predicts match outcomes and has a pick helper. Here is a video that describes how to use it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxs79IsduxQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxs79IsduxQ)

&amp;#x200B;

There are also rollups for statistics for week to week and month to month available to 1 hero and 5 hero combinations available in the ""Summaries"" tab

&amp;#x200B;

You can use the ""Explore"" and ""Combos"" tab to find details about heroes and hero combinations. Here is a video that describes how that works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYqHQygNlg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfYqHQygNlg)

&amp;#x200B;

This project is more of a milestone for me professionally but I think it's a great tool that provides knowledge and insight into dota. A lot of people have written me saying they like it and would like some features changes; I'll be working on those soon. After that  I'll be moving on to another project at some point but I'm going to promote this until I do.

518,/r/Dota2 x Chess,"Hey Now, 

Over the last three months we have seen Dota Chess absolutely explode. It's been exciting to see a custom game take a path paralleling Dota. With Chess we have seen our active community numbers rise above one million concurrent players, a milestone we have not hit for many moons. We have also witnessed numerous tournaments featuring non Dota endemic streamers, bringing new faces and players into the game!

Admittedly, we feel that on /r/dota2 we haven‚Äôt fully embraced Dota Chess. While we continue to love Dota unconditionally, we don‚Äôt want to make an exclusionary community against those who are here for chess, or for those players who regularly play both games. We feel inclusion (in all regards) is of the utmost importance.

That is why today we‚Äôre embracing chess on the subreddit. Fully. We know that this is overdue, but we hope to welcome back in those players new and old to our subreddit.

As always, some of these updates are a work in progress. Any and all feedback is super appreciated.  

Cheers,

520,Which regions need more/less slots,"Since we are well beyond the middle of the season I wanted to approach the slot distribution as objectively as possible. So, I made two tables. One ranking the regions with **DPC_points/Major_slots** and the second table with the same ratio, but after removing the top earner. So we have the following:

**DPC_points/Major_slots**

|Region|Points|Major Slots|Points per major slot|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|CIS| 11,488.00| 2| 5,744.00|
|EU| 11,703.20| 3| 3,901.07|
|CN| 10,569.56| 3| 3,523.19|
|SEA| 4,343.44| 2| 2,171.72|
|NA| 5,801.87| 3| 1,933.96|
|SA| 696.74| 2| 348.37|




**(DPC_points-top earner)/Major_slots**


|Region|Points|Major Slots|Points per major slot|Top Earner|Remove top earner|Points per region after removing top earner|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|--:|
|CN| 10,569.56| 3|3,523.19| 5,850|4,719.56|1573.2|
|EU| 11,703.20| 3|3,901.07| 9,300|2,403.20|801.1|
|SEA| 4,343.44| 2|2,171.72| 3,450| 893.44|446.7|
|NA| 5,801.87| 3|1,933.96| 4,650|1,151.87|384.0|
|CIS| 11,488.00| 2|5,744.00| 10,950| 538.00|269.0|
|SA| 696.74| 2| 348.37| 375| 321.74|160.9|


If we accept that the minimum teams for each region is 2, it's obvious that NA is under-performing with the three slots. Also, we should consider that the extra slot gives more opportunities for free points (essentially you need to get a Bo1 and you get 150 points). On the other hand, 4 slots for a region is overkill (although CN has a very good case), so I would award the NA slot to SEA since they only have 2 right now, they are above NA in both tables and above CIS in the second table.

523,Pangolier got buffed,"As a pango spammer I was really scared when I saw the latest patch, but after a few games I must say its not really tragic. While you can feel the slightly less proc chance on your right clicks, the ""only one debuff at a time"" acutally makes up for it. You can actually choose wheter you like your roll, or you wanna wait out for a new proc. (E.g. ez rosh with perma disarm with lvl 25 talent).

However I really feel buffed in matchup vs TB on lane. I used to constantly get screwed by his first who almost always got at least 4-5 right clicks. Now most of the time with the abyssmal dmg that pango has I hardly notice the reflection.

554,Apply Bounty Hunter's old Jinada effect to Shadow Walk,"Jinada, when changed in 7.20, had its previous maim effect replaced with a midas-style one, which makes sense given its primary function of gold theft. Said maim effect was a nice one, however, and it feels like it should still be part of Bounty Hunter's kit somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

The attack that breaks Shadow Walk slows the target like Jinada used to, but has no visible effect for doing so. Applying the previous maim effect to Shadow Walk would be a nice way to signify the debuff without interfering with Jinada's new function.",DotA2
555,Yet another Kaya upgrade idea,"Most of the Kaya upgrade ideas I have seen seem to make it even better for spell casters in a way, without giving much other utility and taking components with actives that it plays on. This is quite different from the designs of Halberd and Manta, both of which take another passive component and give ability which is not a direct buff to the heroes stat but is none the less desirable.

With that in mind, here is my Kaya upgrade idea: 

Item : 
Khatvanga

Cost : 
4050

Components : 
Kaya + Hyperstone

Disassemble? : 
Yes 

Stats : 
+20 int
12 % spell amp
+14 % mana reduction

Active : 
Oblivion - Target unit is shifted into another dimension for 1.5 seconds. Upon returning, it is dealt 150 magic damage if its an enemy.  

Mana cost : 100
Cooldown : 15 secs.

Idea : Right now dota lacks an item that can save allied heroes from initiation like blackhole or chronosphere or buy them just a few more moments before their skills/items are ready. This item fills that niche. It is also a good item for initiation or counter-initiation. There are a lot of int heroes that could use some attack speed and or save or both. Heroes like storm/od/techies/lina/qop would like the extra attack speed and kaya is also a useful item for most of them. It helps setup spells for some of them as well as provide a possible alternative to Euls if you don't need a purge. Its niche enough to be built on non-int heroes for potential save against necro ult/chrono/blackhole/axe call/duel that otherwise have no item counters.",DotA2

573,i think Drow Strats are officially back.,"My main gripe with the changes to drow is how shit her base agility and her agility gain were. Its what prevented a good push strat ever being possible with Drow.

I even made a post complaining how garbage Drow felt.

But 7.21d has returned Drow Strats.

Now with 2 Wraith Bands, Treads on Agility and Hurricane Pike you basically give almost 2 Moonshards worth of attack speed. And since drow can flash farm so fast once she gets level 6, you can really start buffing your team mapwide.

With a meta of longer lasting games, Drow Strats really do bring a fresh air to the meta. As games end can end in 18-24 minutes if you stomp hard with the Drow Strat.

I feel 7.21d will be the big meta shift.

Funnily Viper still benefits from Drow Strat, and he has been nerfed twice already XD.

The noob trio can shine with this strat. Viper, Sniper and Drow can run a pretty effective Drow Strat.

It was fun, reminded me of the good ol days when i started Dota and Drow, Viper and Sniper popped in every game and i still had no idea what to play. And because the Drow stomped me i thought this hero was OP. It's good to revive the good ol days in actual ranked games XD.",DotA2

***Chess Patch History***

**Patch notes v1.3**

* Checkmate is now required to win. You can no longer win by capturing all pieces other than the King.

**Patch notes v1.4**

* Pawn buff: Pawns that reach the other side of the board can now be promoted to a Vizier, so they can move one diagonal step at a time.

*Developer note: We think pieces that can't move aren't fun, so we're giving the Pawn a bit of extra flexibility in the late game.*

**Patch notes v1.4.1**

* The Vizier has been replaced by the Queen: Queens can now move any number of spaces in all 8 directions, instead of just one diagonal step.
* Bishop buff! Bishops can move any number of spaces diagonally, instead of 2 spaces diagonally.

*Developer note: We wanted to open up the game in a more aggressive direction. We'll be monitoring gameplay and making adjustments as needed.*

**Patch notes v1.4.2**

* New King Ultimate Ability: Once per game, the King can make a knight's move or move two spaces in one direction.

*Developer note: We've heard some complaints about the Queen, calling us SJWs for making an OP female character, or complaining that promoting a pawn to a second Queen supports bigamy. Our only concern is to bring you the best game possible, and we have no plans to nerf the Queen.*

*However, the Queen and Bishop buffs in conjunction have make the King a bit too vulnerable in the center of the board, so we're buffing the King in response by giving it a one-time ult.*

* Pawns that reach the other side of the board can now be promoted to any piece, not just the Queen.

*Developer note: The Vizier to Queen change was a stealth buff to the Pawn. We're happy with that change, but we wanted to provide a bit more flexibility by allowing the Pawn to become any piece.*

**Patch notes v1.5**

* Pawn buff: Pawns can now move two spaces forward if they have not yet moved.

*Developer note: We wanted to speed up the early game and make sure players can get right into the action, so we're buffing the early game Pawn.*

**Patch notes v1.5.1**

* New Pawn Special Ability ""En Passant"": Immediately after a pawn moves two spaces, if it could have been captured by an opposing pawn if it had only moved one space, that opposing pawn can still capture it as if it had only moved one space.

*Developer note: We expect this to be a controversial patch. We want to keep the pawn's special two-space move, but we're seeing that players are using it to bypass their opponent's defenses. We think this will strike the right balance between mobility and defense. Please let us know what you think!*

**Patch notes v1.6**

* King Ultimate Ability, now called ""Castling"": Once per game, if the King and a Rook have not yet moved, the King can move two spaces toward the Rook, and the Rook can be placed on the other side of the King.

*Developer note: This is a refinement of the King's ult that further protects the King while preventing it from using the ult offensively.*

**Patch notes v1.7**

* Pawn nerf: Pawns can now be promoted only to any already captured piece.

**Patch notes v1.8**

* Pawn buff: Pawns can now once again be promoted to any piece, regardless of whether it's been captured.

**Patch notes v1.9**

* BUG FIX: We discovered a bug where the King could use its Castle ability with a newly promoted rook on the other side of the board. This was unintended and has been patched. Kings can now only Castle with rooks on the same rank.

**Patch notes v2.0**

* BUG FIX: We discovered an exploit where players could promote pawns to a piece of the opponent, potentially blocking the opponent's King and forcing wins or stalemates in obscure situations. This bug has been removed, and pawns can now only be promoted to a piece of the same color, as originally intended.

Some of these might not be projectiles, im not quite sure what makes a spell qualify as a projectile, also comment if i missed som spells or items or anything else here isn't correct.

655,Can we please get some regulations around high disparity between ranks?,"It's really annoying to end up on the same team as a Divine 4 and an Archon 2. There are like 24 ranks between them, the gap should be way smaller. Either you get stomped because you have one player who's nowhere near everyone else in the team, or you might get carried by a ""smurf"" who goes mid and stomps, either way it's not a fun game. I don't play to gain ranks, I play for even and fun matches, that means playing against people around my skill. I don't want to play vs or with people who are 14 ranks above me and 10 ranks below me because they queued together. If you queue together, you should be forced to be close in rank, this is absurd.

Just played an Ancient-ranked game, where we had the Divine player who queued with some obvious beginner who went 0-18 shadow shaman. Just makes no sense, every other game forces you to be close in rank, but in DotA you don't even need smurfs, just queue with people with really low mmr.

657,"Jikininki , the spirit of madness. The idea of a new hero.","&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ig3h0516vop21.jpg

    Hello! I have a lot of ideas about new characters in my favorite game. 
    Do you think this hero can exist in the game?
    And I apologize in advance for the level of English of my translator.

Jikininki is a ranged intelligence hero.  He has a good ability to control the enemy. His first ability, ""**Hunger**"", to a certain extent causes the enemy damage to his current health, and reduces HP regeneration and healing by 60% for 6 seconds . Also Jikininki skill restores health in the amount of damage caused to the enemy. The second ability, ""**Fear of Death**"", scares the chosen enemy, forcing him to flee to the base. The third ability, ""**Invisible Evil**"", is passive and makes the hero almost invisible, and also allows him to poison and slow down the enemy when attacking from stealth. The last skill, ""**Spirit of Madness""**, creates an area around the hero in which the enemies go crazy and begin to attack each other. If an enemy leaves the area before the ability expires, his mind will clear up.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/rvjti3o6vop21.png

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;¬†¬†¬†¬†  **Jikininki** very vaguely recalled his past life, even his name was lost, and no one knew the name of this evil spirit during his lifetime. He was born a long time ago in one of the noble houses and from childhood got used to the servants around him. Despite the attempts of his parents to cultivate a good and decent person from him, from childhood their heir showed only the most terrible character traits: he was cruel, rude, closed in himself and loved to mock his servants. With age, everything only worsened, and when parents left this world under mysterious circumstances, the whole village howled from the tyranny and persecution of this monster. He loved to punish for any mistakes with a whip, to torture servants, to make them fight a friend for fun. At a certain point, the  **Jikininki** madness passed to a new level, and he became interested in black magic. Now it was not limited to simple mockery, people began to disappear en masse: small children disappeared from the cradles, women disappeared on the way to the river, and strong men did not return from the forest near the manor. Jikininki‚Äôs face has also changed: his skin has become thinner and grayer, rotten spots have appeared on his face, his body has become dry and twisted, his eyes have become terribly insane. Sometimes he disappeared in his room for several weeks, and it was at such moments that people disappeared in the village. On one of these countless terrible days, when several babies disappeared, the terror of the inhabitants turned into a desire to stop everything, people grabbed forks, sticks, axes and swords and fell into insanity to destroy the estate. The house was burned to the ground, but they did not find **Jikininki** , and his room, when a distraught crowd burst into it, turned out to be surprisingly empty, covered with dust and cobwebs, as if no one lived here. Unsatisfied with revenge, people began to search, and after a couple of hours of walking from the estate, they found a hut in the forest, filled to the ceiling with the remains of all the missing people. Behind the hut they saw **Jikininki** , bewitched by the body of the missing child, covered with blood. Do we need to talk about how strong the fear and disgust of the crowd was at the sight of this picture? With rage, people attacked the monster, beat and stabbed him. But at some point one of the lumberjacks suddenly turned and struck his neighbor with an ax, another warrior stopped the sword in the backswing and aimed the blade at his friend. The crowd began to beat itself, and through the cries of pain and the sound of weapons came the angry and inanimate laughter of the creature, which crawled into the forest. His mind was different, not human, part of the bloodied body began to dissolve in the air, his eyes burned with red fire, and his lips whispered: ""I finished the ritual, I reached."" Nobody returned from the forest to the village. Other people fled from this cursed place, leaving behind their homes and property. And even when the ashes and the village disappeared over the centuries and became part of the dense forest, and the story of the bloodthirsty **Jikininki** became just a scary story for the children of neighboring villages, no one dared to spend the night in the forest, because many people were missing. But, those lucky ones who were lucky enough to return, became uncommunicative and frightened old men. They said they saw something from the other world in the forest. This creature was driving people crazy, forcing them to kill each other, and then eating corpses.

# Abilities:

&amp;#x200B;

[Hunger](https://i.redd.it/edh8or4avop21.jpg)

**Ability**: Target enemy unit

**Damage**: magical

**Range of use**: 550

**Damage**: 15% / 17% / 18% / 20 of the current health of the enemy.

**Treatment**: 15% / 17% / 18% / 20 of the current amount of enemy Hp.

**Reduces the recovery of the target's health**: 70%

**Duration**: 6

**Cooldown**: 20/17/15/13

&amp;#x200B;

Deals magical damage to the enemy in the amount of a certain percentage of his current health, and also reduces the recovery of the target's health by 60% for 6 seconds. The ability restores the health of the spirit in an amount equal to the damage inflicted on the enemy.

*Note: counts the amount of damage in% ratio of hp lost by the enemy and recovers equivalently xp to the hero. That is, if you use the ability on an enemy from 2000 current HP, then the damage done to him at the last skill level will be 400 HP. On 400 hp the spirit will recover.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Fear of Death](https://i.redd.it/rhz2acgbvop21.jpg)

**Ability**: Target enemy unit

**Range of use**: 400

**Duration**: 2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 4 seconds

**Cooldown**: 25/21/18/15.

Frightens the selected creature and makes him run to the base for a certain time.

*Note: does not affect units invulnerable to magic. Dispelled by basic cleansing.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Invisible Evil](https://i.redd.it/14stk2rcvop21.jpg)

**Ability**: Passive

**Time to invisibility after the attack**: 4/3/2/1.5

**Damage to the enemy in a second**: 20/32/45/60

**The duration of the poisoning of the enemy**: 3/4/5/6

**Slow down the enemy movement speed**: 15/18/22/25%

Jikininki merges with the environment, it becomes almost invisible to enemies. When struck from invisibility, he poisons the enemy and slows his speed. Poisoning and slowing down the enemy is possible every 20 seconds.

*Note: Jikininki invisibility is not absolute, like other heroes. Enemies see the shadow and traces of the spirit, blurred (almost invisible to the eyes) outlines of the body. The model of the hero under the influence of this ability should be made so that it would be difficult to notice with a quick glance, but with proper observation the enemy would understand that the spirit is near. In addition, the spirit can not be taken in the goal as long as it is not under the action of  Dust of Appearance,  Sentry Ward.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Spirit of Madness](https://i.redd.it/41dh3yrhvop21.jpg)

**Ability**:  No Target

**Radius**: 400

**Duration**: 3 / 3,5 / 4

**Cooldown**: 100/90/80

The hero reveals his invisibility and becomes the center of madness, forcing the enemies around him to attack each other. If an enemy leaves an area of ‚Äã‚Äãability before the expiration of an ability, his mind will clear up.

*Note: Dzikininki can move, use other abilities and items during the skill action. But while the ability works, it is visible to the enemies. Enemies that fall into the range of ability, begin the search for the nearest victim (priority characters) also within the range of ability. That is, they ignore goals that are not affected by insanity. If the enemy kills his ally when the ability is active, he goes on to search for the next target.*

*If the enemy leaves the zone of action, his mind will clear up. But in a random way this will happen only if Dzikininki moves too fast and the enemy falls out of the zone. Otherwise, the ability acts on the enemy in such a way that his movement algorithm prohibits him from leaving the range of the ability, and he will try to move only inside the circle around Dzikininki.*

*A hero who has fallen under the action of an ability can be driven out of the range of ability with the help of Nether Swap, Force Staff, etc. Then the effect of madness will be dispelled. Conversely, if you change the location of the enemy and place within the range of sposbnosti, he will also fall under the influence of madness and begin to attack his allies in the field of ability.*

676,How to counter Invoker?,"Hi, I'm a dead set Invoker main at 2.8k mmr looking to improve and rank up to legend (archon 7 atm). As I said I main Invoker. I love him, he's challengeing, really fun to play, has huge impact on the game etc. But, every hero has it's counters, and even tho I'm almost level 14 with Invoker, I'm still pretty bad at knowing what counters him.

So, if it's a decent or good Game for Invoker I will pick him, but say someone counterpicks before I do. So my question is:

What heroes counter Invoker hard (in the mid lane), and what heroes in turn counter them?

My plan is to master Invoker and the ""counter counters"".",DotA2

684,Region Slots for this Major,"I'm sure this has been mentioned a few times but i'll say it again so its actually different next time. The quality of NA dota aside from EG falls dramatically which makes sense because there are much fewer players, they play League and other games. The max NA should get for any tournament is 2 slots.

Europe and China should both be minimum 3 slots.

Now the question is who should get the last slot? It can be either SEA or CIS. In this case I think TNC should have gotten the third slot. Otherwise reserve two slots for minor tournament winners/runner ups.

I know in the long run it may not make a difference, the team may get knocked out early on etc. but in  terms of the quality of dota we know which regions are stronger and which have stronger teams, hence they deserve the small prize money.

&amp;#x200B;

I was actually playing dota 2-4 time a day and got my mmr from 3,5k to 4,4k in some months.

I always play as pos 5 and pos 3 (nature and dark seer spammer, no shame).

&amp;#x200B;

I got my first job last year, and since i've started i can only play at the weekends.

The first thing that i noticed was my reaction time and mechanical skills that got really rusted. My mmr drop from 4500 to 3800. I couldn't follow 100% the patchs and metas during that time, so basically i couldn't be 100% efficient in the matches.  


Until the last calibration my mmr was stuck in the 3900 range. But lucky in the new season i got calibrated as Ancient 7 4900 (i couldn't believe at first). After some months playing and some loss and wins i got Divine 1 (4926). My goal is to reach Immortal rank, but for that i know that i need to get better and improve overall skills and unfortunately i can't spend all my time on that.

&gt; Im member of support on https://d2flex.com , and I have access to the admin panel, where I can choose winners,but theres a problem

&gt; I cant do it for myself, because owner of site blocked bets from my IP address, steam profiles etc. However, I can choose another people, for example - you as a winner, but then you give me 50% of winnings, which you take
	U participate in the jackpot,i make u win and we split items u win 50/50. This is the plan

His domain was made just a week ago: https://i.imgur.com/0YRw3hv.png - but he was pretending like it was some legitimate trading / gambling site

Sounded like a scam, so I figured why not scam bait him for a while, see what's up.

Well, first he wanted to show me proof that what he was saying was true, so he ""predicted"" a bunch of people that would win

First he said a guy called UMBRA would win, and then he did: https://i.imgur.com/5TvEBCa.png

Then he said someone called ""-TOO- Merkaba"" would win, which he did: https://i.imgur.com/TmzWuWy.png

So, he did proof that he actually does own the site, and can manipulate the results

He tried to get me to login with my main account for a while, which I did not want to do, because I didn't wanna risk losing anything accidentally. I don't know how much he can do through the steam API after I'm logged in. So I was claiming for a while that it did not work on my main account. Then said I'd try a different account:

The optics seem to be that it is very, very top heavy which has turned off some of my friends to watching since any given year you can guess who is going to TI and who will win the majors whith who wins TI being the only real exception to this.

Over the weekend I was at a gaming convention in Albany, NY where they had simultaneous fortnite, overwatch and LoL tourneys going being played my local colleges. I noticed that with fortnite they would have duos running but a team of players that they would swap out in those two active spots. It added a huge variety to match.

My thought was what if dota rosters flexed to 7 players. With the extra 2 having minimum play requirements in the tourney (say like a minimum  Bo3 each). This would help get tier 2 players expierance with the top players and more exposure while also cutting down on stand-ins and player fatigue (I saw some people bring this up as VP lost to ViCi last major). This would also introduce some upsets as tier 2 teams play against a team like secret with one or both of their alternates in. 

I would love to here the feedback. Maybe there is a bunch i am missing that would make this inworkable.",DotA2

I am organizing a 1v1 mid Dota2  Tournament; it is a ""test"" tournament. What I mean with ""test"" is that the number of participants is small, 16, and there are some ad-hoc rules that I would like to try before make a bigger event.

For instance,on game 1 players have to agree on which hero to pick (*between Pudge, Invoker, Shadow Fiend, Queen of Pain, Lina*). From game 2, the loser of game 1 can pick any hero. 

Game are best of 3 and players must pick the same hero. For the complete rules, [click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vT-8nCeSTIsA6SAlXk6BdHMShjVvCxkKp_23iidNU0I/edit?usp=sharing).

The pre-registration can be done via [toornament](https://www.toornament.com/tournaments/2280768022924296192/information); the whole tournament should end in 5-6 weeks. 

The entry fees is 10$+2$: 10$ goes into the prize pool whereas the 2$ are for the administration fees. Every week there will be a ""game day"" (THU) where players will play at least 2 matches; myself and other administrators will follow the matches to make sure everything runs smoothly.

**MY BACKGROUND**

I have been organizing sport leagues and tournament for the past 15 years; as a dota player, I have always wanted to create a dota tournament, so I decided to start with this small event. Regarding the entry fees, it has been a choice driven by experience: people is more likely to commit when they are economically involved (i.e. it avoids leave the tournament, do not turn up, etc). Moreover, it adds more ""thrill"" to the competition :)",DotA2

751,"10+ Years of DOTA, trying to be better - How do I improve?","I'll do my best not to go into a long rant here. I've played DOTA on and off for many years. When League of Legends came out I switched to that, then switched to DOTA 2 and played since the closed beta. The large majority of that time I played pretty casually just aiming to have fun with a group of friends and never really focus to try and be better. Until recently.

&amp;#x200B;

The highest I've been was slightly over 4k mmr. I feel as though my knowledge, mechanics and general strategy are okay, but can't seem to win. (So I'm clearly not as good as I think) I've looked up every guide I could find, watched many hours of coaching sessions on YouTube (3.5-4k mmr) but don't feel like I'm improving.  


TL:DR

I'm hoping one of you can steer me in the right direction or inform me of something I'm oblivious to needing to work on to get better at DOTA 2.

758,A support player's harrowing journey to try to learn carry,"I play support. I'm a real bad player, barely 2k. During a pause I saw the tip that said ""Playing a carry makes you a better support player and vice versa"" So I figured hey, why not, lets play some carry to become a better support. So I queued as safe lane and now, an afternoon and 6 lost games later I have to ask, why do people like this role?

You have to endure some of the world's worst early games. On the other side of the lane there is an offlaner who has like triple your attack damage and a faster attack animation so good luck getting any last hits or denies.

 And you don't even get to play Dota. Instead you play the click creeps- minigame for god knows how long. You stare at the descending health bars for so long that your fingers start hurting from having to be in a constant state of tension cause if you click even a fraction of a second late, you're not getting that last hit. Your eyes get red from not blinking cause those health bars go down fast, gotta learn the fucking exact millisecond when you have to attack. If I wanted to hit things at exact moments with a big punishment for missing, I'd play Guitar Hero. Fuck that. 

So then you finish your item only to realize that you're not gonna be getting anything done in a team fight because you need that stupid ass item BKB. So back to clicking creeps for an eternity just so you can actually play the game for 10 seconds. I mean 9 seconds. I mean 8^seconds^actually 7 seconds^No really its 6^5seconds

And even if you click on the health bars well enough to get your item, your mandatory ""play Dota for 10 seconds with this"" -membership card, what do you get to do? Click on heroes instead of creeps! Just attack move to the other side of the team fight and lay back in your chair and watch as your character deals a billion damage per second without you having to do a thing. Exciting point and click adventure! 

Oh and speaking of team fights, you know who wants to target you first? Who wants to counter your pick specifically so that not even your precious detour-from-actual-fun-items BKB is gonna save you? Who wants to gank you during the laning stage relentlessly? Fucking everybody, that's who. Can't let that safe lane carry have a fun today, no sir! And then your team has the audacity to yell at you for only completing that battlefury at 18 minutes. Like yeah, I had to lane against complete early game monsters, what do you want me to do, go sacrifice 80% of my health for a single last hit? Didn't see you teleport a single time when I got dived for the 3rd time. Fucking Invoker players right? 

So after all of that, who gets all the blame and flame once everything falls apart? Who gets reported even though your only crime was not clicking on creeps fast enough? You do, my friend, you do. 

So did playing carry make me a better support player? I don't know, probably not. It made me realize however that the reason why carry players are so often the ones to blame their team is because they're not playing dota. They're playing Click Creeps 3000, and very different rules apply there. 

Thanks for reading. Hopefully you got atleast a chuckle out of my misery. Good night and take care.

791,Why is castling a thing???,Why the fuck is castling a legitimate thing???Seriously???? Oh here let me just magically have two pieces jump over each other and place them anywhere in the row and do two moves in one. Makes no fucking sense unlike the rest of the other moves in the game! Beyond broken!!!!,DotA2
793,Why does NA still have 3 slots? [Serious],"Im in NA and love NA dota but our t2 scene is dogshit and I think getting a 3rd slot is waste. Obviously being able to play with better teams grows the scene, but is the DPC a charity for the NA t2 scene? It should be based on merit.

If you look at the current DPC rankings, you would think NA should get the 3rd slot, but the region only has some teams in there because they got into the major through the 3rd slot. I am a student with lots of free time, so I get to watch a lot of dota, and NA t2 is much weaker than all the other regions' t2 scenes except SA (even then they are not that far behind NA).

This 3rd NA slot could go to any another region. CIS and SEA are the first options. I would pick CIS right now because there are a few teams that have shown top level play including Gambit, Old but Gold, Navi, and Empire (we will have to see how they fare at the major).

The extra slot could even go to China giving them 4 slots, but I think maxing regions to 3 allows all the regions to have better representation.

Tbh, the real reason I think NA still has 3 slots is because Valve is lazy as fuck, and they haven't bothered to change anything because its not that big of a deal.",DotA2
794,2.8k easier then 1.1k,"low behavior score 1.1k acc - 9 losing streak playing support dazzle my best hero that I went 21/4 w/l recently on my main. Can't believe I climbed out of that hell this is legit harder then where my main is at now, and the worst thing is mid is impossible to get.  ",DotA2
795,New to chess. Am I missing something?,"So, bit of background, I started with League of Checkers and moved into Backgammon before the removal of the BG Pro Circuit totally killed the community. Finally decided to bite the bullet and join the big leagues with Chess.

So, first is a meta question. Have we always had this 15p1 strat so dominant? It seems like every game I play the King is demanding ward vision and sacrificial plays just to survive so he can, what, move a single square at a time? Even Pawns do that and we have 8 of them so what's the big deal? I guess it's just not connecting for me, cause in Checkers basically everyone starts as a Pawn and can be Kinged (our term for ""promoted"" lol) into a King.

Speaking of which, second, it seems like I'm almost never getting to promote my Pawns. Are my games just not going late enough to get that level of farm, or is there like a combo I can pull off with en passants to make sure I'm getting into the right position? I don't expect to promote every Pawn every game til I have more experience, but it feels like it should be happening way way more.

Third, Knights are just overpowered, right? Their flanking moves are just always putting them into positions where I'm having trouble predicting what's next. Is this just a degenerate strat I'm going run into at my ELO? Relatedly, I've seen people mostly promote to Queens, why aren't they just taking Knights?

Anyway, thanks in advance for your help!",DotA2
796,"En passant is fine, the pawn ultimate is actually broken.","Who's idea was it to let a hero just transform into any other hero with all their abilities?  This one ability is almost always enough to just win on the spot.  It makes you focus so much attention on this one hero who can just Press R and win.

Absolutely ridiculous.",DotA2
797,"Transitioning from League to DOTA, Confused about Macro","I've played League for over six years, been getting burnt out as of late. Experimented with other MOBAs like HotS and Dawngate (anyone remember that?), but always admired DOTA as a more demanding MOBA, yet struggled to get into it. I understand a lot of the micro like handling multiple units, farming and denying, blocking and pulling creeps, etc; my main struggle is understanding the macro of DOTA, being so used to LoL's laning dynamics, and its transition into the teamfight phase, while DOTA still seems really foggy and confusing in that regard.

In League, I main ADC (first position, I think it's called in DOTA), though I'm fine at any position other than jungle. Played about 150 games of DOTA scattered over the last couple years, learning what heroes I like, but never got used to laning. Laning in LoL revolves around trades, dealing small amounts of damage to the enemy which add up over time until they're low enough for an all-in, while in DOTA you can't really do that because of high mana costs and hefty minion aggro, unless you take a hero that specializes in it like TA, Luna, Zeus, or Sniper. Generally, every engagement is either a one-sided burst combo (Lina), a skirmish involving full rotations of spells or several attacks, or a full on kill commitment (preferably with a gank). I might be missing something, but it just feels like a feast or famine dynamic with massive snowballing once one side gets ahead, and that doesn't feel very satisfying, even when I'm the one feasting. If there's a different way to approach laning, I'm not aware of it, or at least I've had no success attempting it.

I also struggle to see when the laning phase ends and team fight phase begins, if DOTA even has phases comparable to those of LoL. In League, laners start roaming more once they take their first tower, and grouped pushes start happening frequently once most or all of the first tier towers are down, also often grouping for Nashor. It could just be because I'm very low elo in DOTA and have equally confused teammates, but I never see a clear phase transition in DOTA, which makes learning how I'm supposed to progress in the game when much more difficult to understand.

I've watched Purge for a long time, but even watching gameplay hasn't really illuminated these things for me, especially since casual play looks very different than high level play. I'm just wondering if there's any advice I could get on the macro of this game, so I actually know what I'm supposed to be doing when rather than running around the map like a chicken with its head cut off until teamfights start happening.",DotA2
798,Would a team of 6k MMR player dominate TI1 ?,"Been watching some old nostalgic videos in youtube and realised that many pro players from ti1 have extremely sloppy movement.

838,Valve please stop matching new players with high mmr players.,"Some time ago Valve made it so that new players would get matched with old players so that it would improve the quality for them. This is not what is happening at all. Instead we get matched with smurfs 100% of the time. Now i don't mind playing with or against players that are good but the thing is that they are new accounts. So these players don't mind throwing. They throw everytime they find something that they don't like. Not getting roles, dying once when supports don't tp or team not following them when they run in a suicide mission. Its just too much. I am a student and when i get to play dota this is it 100% of the time. Either i queue ranked where i have to try my absolute best or unranked where i can't even play casually. Its just too frustrating so please Valve make it so that we get queued with players that are not new accounts and players that don't throw.

I played two game in my off time today and both games new accounts. I thought it would be fine and competition would be high as they were obviously smurfs. But halfway they just throw the game because they don't care and they can just make new accounts and this affects us players that have been on one account and reduce quality for both of us.

885,[HELP] 4k player now stacked at 3k,"from my first account my highest solo mmr is about 4.4k i worked with it from 3.3k to 4.4k mostly playing pos4/5 around 4.2k i started playing pos 1/3, but there was a time that i forgot to bring my phone with steamguard on the cafe so that i needed to create another account just to play with my friends so. that account (2nd account) reach a party mmr like 4.5k while the solo is 3.1-3.2k tbh i sold my first account to a friend because of financial problem, i promise its not intentional that first account even have IO arcana, kunka's limited immortal and some good not tradable items/bundle like Shattered Greatsword of sven and Diabolic Aspect of CK. if only i don't need money that time :(  so what i'm using right now is my 2nd account. after the last calibration it went to 3.5k solo and 4.2k party but when i started playing solo to climbed up to 4k again im always losing ending up my solo to 3.1k. at first i guess its because i'm always playing support and unlucky to have a good cores. so i tried playing as core but the same thing happened. can you help me? what am i doing wrong? i mean i manage to climbed up from my first account but on my second account im floating between 3.1k-3.5k. im really sorry for my bad english and grammar.

right now i cant provide my first account dotabuff profile, im still asking my friend i will post it as soon as i got it from my friend

888,Who would want to read a book about Dota? And what would they want in it?,"Hi everyone. I hope that this isn't too unusual a question for the subreddit, but I was would like to gauge interest in a potential book about Dota and what people would like to see in it.

The reason I ask this is that Dota has been a pretty big part of my life over the last three or four years, and I have often wondered how I could best contribute to the community. I don't play very well and never will; and I don't have the skill set to do video, as many other talented people do on Youtube and Twitch, etc. But I was a journalist for ten years, and I think that Dota - and esports in general - is missing a good non-fiction book that would be of interest to both people who play the game, as well as a more general audience that know that esports is a big thing, but don't really know how to find out about it. I have been thinking about what that book might look like.

The model might lie in books about extreme/niche sports - such as mountaineering and long-distance running. These are activities that can take over people's lives and put them through extraordinarily difficult situations. Telling the stories of hardcore mountaineers and the community that they are in, or crazy runners is kind of cool; and I think these books resonate well with people who participate in these sports, and people who are interested in this kind of lifestyle. The only problem I foresee is there is something viscerally compelling about someone who lost three fingers and two toes to climb Everest. Fucking up your shoulder sitting in front of the computer and playing too much DOTA, doesn't really have the same impact...

The stories of individual players could give the book a sense of narrative (but avoiding the ""OMFG people play video games for money!!!"" angle that you tend to find when non-specialist media writes about esports). The business angle of things is very interesting, and the more I find out by talking to people in the industry, the more I realise how little good info is out there (i.e. it tends to be hearsay online). And then there is the game itself, because DOTA is such a uniquely special game, it would be crucial to highlight what makes people coming back to the game after accumulating many thousands of hours over several years (something my non-gaming friends don't get at all). The mysterious story of Ice Frog is also very very cool.

Do you think something like this might work? Are there any books you might suggest that might be a good example? (i read lot of non-fiction, but never anything about sport). I'd be really interested in hearing your feedback.

https://i.redd.it/imeyzz1kolp21.jpg

So I had this avatar set as an ironic profile pic on my account, I thought it would make for some funny responses from players who saw it. I load up steam today and for some reason it was removed from my profile, and it says I can't make changes to my profile until April 28? What gives valve?! How is this picture offensive to you?! Some triggered russian probably reported it and valve banned it?! But how is this even offensive?!?!?! I'm trying to understand. Any clarification on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Just wanted to mention the fact that I often get accounts that are clearly being boosted (meepo spam and 5-6 rank ups in the past week), and obvious account buyers (legend or archon last season, divine this season, play like a 2k going 0-7 on mid at 12 minutes in the game), and I always report them. Somehow, nothing is ever done to those account buyers and boosters, but somehow my profile pic gets removed and I can't change my avatar for 30 days?!",DotA2

906,The worst griefer I have encountered in my almost 3k hours in dota. I need help Kindly review this.,"Match ID: 4597593209

&amp;#x200B;

Griefer played as: Riki

&amp;#x200B;

What griefer did:

&amp;#x200B;

afk (lvl 6 the whole game)

&amp;#x200B;

bought all the wards and placed them on top of our jungle camps (blocking them).

&amp;#x200B;

called out all times I tried to rosh (I play as Ursa this game, so rosh is a big deal).

&amp;#x200B;

griefed courrier.

&amp;#x200B;

tried to farm rapier to feed to the enemy team.

&amp;#x200B;

Bought all the tomes.

&amp;#x200B;

Fed himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Was being toxic and bad mouthed the whole game.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried several times to calm him down, but he wanted to prove his point

(that necro buying his tome in the beginning would ruin the game for us, it would not)

&amp;#x200B;

Please, I beg of you, if you read this. Watch the demo and help me get this to someone that can do something about it. 

That was my 4-5th game in a row and I have only had griefers today. My ""social score"" in

dota is 6,769. I should not be getting people like this in my game. I really try hard, and this ruins it for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I have almost 3k hours in dota, and this is by far the worst I have ever seen anyone grief.

It was not possible for me as an ursa player to do anything this game. He shut down all the possibilities

943,"As a support being told ""great job"", ""good gank"", ""that made us win the lane"" etc. really makes me happy!","No big reason behind this. Had a few good games today in which I was commended for a few good moves. Ganking mid while he was having a hard time, placing the right ward to give sight in a fight.

It's not often I have been told it was a good move or well played. So I just wanted to share and remind that good words help.

947,"Position Six Podcast featuring lizZard - talking about the difficulty balancing playing with casting, his 'persona' (or lack thereof) as a talent, the Dreamleague Major and much more.","Hello all!

I've released the latest episode (episode 21) of the Position Six Podcast, with one of the most exciting new casters and analysts, lizZard.

We spoke about the difficulty trying to be both a pro and a talent at the same time - and his belief in being a pro - how lizZard sees himself on screen, the Dreamleague Major, the weaknesses and struggles of the Balkans and much more.

Sorry to those of you who have been patiently waiting for the past 2 weeks for new episodes, I had a tonne of technical difficulties outside of my control and a guest let me down. I'm back on track now.

951,Charity Stream for Kitties !,"Hey guys, I'm bowie! You might know me from my youtube videos or more recently for some of my casts. 

For a while I've been looking for a way to give back all the love I found within the dota community. I remember a lot of charity streams in the past that were awesome and had great goals but I never found an org that I would like to give back to.

Until a friend of mine (one that saw the beginning) of my dota journey move to the city I live now. We used to live together because of college and even adopted this beautiful [fluffy ball](https://imgur.com/UHjRDyY) together . Her name is Kira and we adopted it through a local and small cat org called [gato miah](https://www.facebook.com/gatomiah/) . They might be small but they do a great job at it. They're all about ""responsible adoption"" meaning they want to know whether you have the means from reasonable wealth to provide the cat a good life to a residence with the appropriate nets to prevent the cat to run away.

They visited us and the process was amazing. I loved every second with this cat and my friend takes amazing care of her to this day. So yeah the goal here is to raise money for them so they can keep doing their job !

Their job is amazing because they're not only looking to find homeless cats owners. First they take care of all the ""problems"" that they might have from castrating them to any medical issues and they even try to pair the cats personalities with the owner! They help people that lost their cats to find them using their [page](https://scontent.fgru5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/55803425_2105654636168194_2443775407183364096_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fgru5-1.fna&amp;oh=96deefdd6447643ddeb4c337ed987eac&amp;oe=5D08064C)

My stream will be 12-24h long. I would like to say I'm 100% committing to 24h but since I never did it that's why I'm leaving it open and here's how things will work:

* **I will only play heroes that can summon creatures that are controlable : Beastmaster, Broodmother, Chen, Enigma, LD, Lycan, NP, Visage, Warlock.** 
* **For every Loss I will donate 5 dolars from my own pocket to them.**
* **Chat will be able to select which hero I'll play every game from an interactive poll but I will never play the same hero twice in a row**

* **All the money that comes from donations during the stream will also be directed towards gato miah**

* **The stream will happen on April 17 (Wednesday) time yet to be decided in my [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/d2bowi3)**


Edit: Vote [here](https://www.strawpoll.me/17738675) if you want more hero options that have ""creatures"" like luna, mirana, etc.

952,"Valve, please clean-up your cosmetics","There‚Äôs so many cosmetics that have broken or glitched out over the years, it‚Äôs really quite sad.

961,Some statistics surrounding qualifier slots.,"**Average placement for the Majors:**

NA: (7+7+13+3+9+13+3+9+9)/9 = 8,11

CIS: (1+13+13+2+2+13)/6 = 7,33

EU: (4+9+13+1+7+13+2+4+9)/9 = 6,88

China: (1+5+5+13+4+5+7+13+5+7+13)/11 = 7,09

SEA: (13+7+5+5+9+3+9)/7 = 7,29

SA: (9+9+9+9+9+13)/6 = 9,67

**Average placement for Minors:**

NA: (7+5+5+3)/4 = 5

CIS: (2+2+2+3)/4 = 2,25

EU: (7+5+5+4+5)/5 = 5,2

China: (3+3+1+7+1)/5 = 3

SEA: (1+7+7)/3 = 5

SA: (7+5+4)/3 = 5,33

When considering placements with more than one team at the same tier, all were considered the highest spot, so 13 was the lowest possible placement for majors, and 7th for minors.

**Ranking for Majors:**

EU&gt;China&gt;SEA&gt;CIS&gt;NA&gt;SA

**Ranking for Minors:**

CIS&gt;China&gt;NA=SEA&gt;EU&gt;SA

**Compared to the next Major &amp; Minor invites:**

Disneyland got 3 EU slots. Completely fair, they're the best on average. 3 China is also fair, they're the second best on average. But somehow, NA, the second worst region on average, gets 3 slots as well?

Same story with the minor. China getting 2 slots is fair, but EU, the second worst performing region in minors on average, gets 2 slots?

NA's major slot should go to SEA and EU's minor slot should go to CIS.

If you want to complain that outliers like VP affect the average too much, that's fine.",DotA2
962,A message to players in lower brackets,"Supports

Please stop blocking the first wave on the safelane. The enemy creeps end up under tower and the lane equilibrium is fucked, and a level 1 core can't farm them. Stop drawing aggro from creeps by harrassing the enemy if they're solo. The lane will push and they'll get exp and farm under the safety of their tower, or close to it, that they shouldn't. Stop hanging around the lane if your core can manage it on their own. Pull creeps if the lane gets pushed in.

I know practically nobody plays this role as a choice in this bracket, but when you do play it, do it right. These things make a lot of difference and they matter.

Everyone, stop taking the courier from mid when they need it. Manage your resources such that you won't. Take a close look at the side-shop, don't ever buy those items at the start of the game or bring them on the courier, unless you really can't visit the thing.  The mid's courier usage is the most important at this stage in the game. It's a 1v1 and whoever wins it will set the pace of the game until the main core farms up. This is extremely important to understand. Roam mid if you can actually do something, but don't go there on your Pudge to steal exp and c/s a bunch of creeps.

Cores, stop farming jungle for no reason. Lanes need pushing, towers need defending. The only scenario where you should farm jungle is if it's unsafe to do anything else on the map. The moment  that one hero that kills you shows on the map, go straight to a different lane and push it/farm it/pressure it into their towers. This will elicit a response from the enemy team, they'll have to rotate heroes to defend and that will open up space for you to farm elsewhere.

Stop using your TPs stupidly. They have a very long cooldown. You want to get the most value out of your TP, so using it to place yourself somewhere you could have simply walked is a really dumb idea. A TP can function as freedom of choice. You can either do this, or that. But if you use it for nothing, the choice is gone. You're now stuck to where you TP-ed for 80 seconds. It's either that or walk right back to where you TP-ed from, either case means wasted time and opportunities. Having it off-cooldown means you can be instantly active when and where it matters.",DotA2
966,Who is your favorite hero you suck at?,"Had a good discussion in my DotA chat group, curious to hear your answers.

Who is a hero you love playing, but generally lose games with?

Mine is dark seer. He's so much fun, but I am dreadful. 38% WR in ~100 games. Vacuum into wall is so much fun, however losing my ancient is not. 

How about you?

I've also encountered an issue where the app is extremely laggy. Like, 3 FPS laggy. This only happens on the predictions page, and only started after the OGA Minor matches were added. I assume this is because the app has too many matches loaded at once but my phone isn't lightweight, it should definitely be able to handle the work.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

But, this thread not about this particular smurfers or whatever term is right there. And since I remember that there is no right place other than Reddit to ask Valve something, I just wanna ask a single question one more time ‚Äî **When Valve will provide us a tool to report blatant game ruiners?**. 


There is only 3 steps needed:

1. Mark people who got reported in same **ranked** match by **8+ different** players from both sides.

2. After 3-5 successful marks **per month** (or three months, whatever feels right) check marked players and initiate checking their matches for ""unusual activity"".

3. ""Unusual activity"" could include several tests like:

 - swings in KDA, GPM, XPM, (maybe APM if this is so important).

 - some keywords in allchat/teammates chat.

 - some rare checks like number of courier kills (5+), time of first blood and number of heroes participated in it.

&amp;nbsp;

You may say that this system would have multiple false positive alarms &gt;!like Gosu.AI!&lt; when people would report Arteezy or Bulldog just for fun, but recheck all 3 points above and you'll see that this would happen in far less than 0.5% of matches. Considering number of reports available per week and number of Venoms in this game number of false positives would be even less. 
&gt;!Plot twist: Valve will remove Random Draft from MMR search!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**tldr:** two friends somehow abusing game search ruining other people's game and noone can prevent this since reporting system doesn't work. Or probably I'm to impatient and can't wait for new reliability system.

I marked this under discussion to hear your opinions on it.

It could be a feature for the few, if any, that have all of the hero relics for every hero already. However, it's much more likely a flaw that was overlooked. Should DotA still have that as an option? Wouldn't it be better if a notification popped-up and warned ""You have already collected all the available relics for this hero.

1020,"Scandal in CIS community: Kodos, Team Empire midlaner accused of cheating in the Major Qualifiers finals","I haven't seen any posts on it yet, however the topic is pretty contraversial. 

# What happened? 

It started with the CIS caster and analyst PGG claiming that he [noticed the signs of cheating](https://clips.twitch.tv/CautiousCrepuscularLemur4Head) in the Team Empire - Na'Vi match. He claimed that Kodos, the midlaner of Team Empire, used cheating software to block the creeps because of too much APM and the ""suspitious black line"" next to the cursor. Team Empire manager Korben and CIS caster 4ce argued PGGs claim. 

V1lat asked pro players and analysts to check out the moment of blocking creeps in more details, and he described the overall reaction as  ""Almost ideal blocking, which currently can be seen only from Open AI bots""

# Further suspitions:

After the hype was brought up, CIS community noticed other moments, which at least require a closer look. 

1) [Euls on Axe on T2 tower](https://youtu.be/01o2CJNnYm8)

2) [Item Drop in the side shop](https://youtu.be/Mq-pOBSRQng)

I don't want to accuse anyone too early and I think it definetely requires an investigation , I'll just leave those clips for you to decide whether cheating took place their or not. 

# Media Reaction

Ilya ""Illidan"" Pivcaev about the creep block - ""it is a regular bind you can set up in 2 seconds, it is not APM or something forbidden. 

Nikita ""4ce"" Kotkov claimed that Kodos clicked Euls on Axe before he jumped, so when the distance got broken by Axe's blink, the Eul got activated

Artem ""fng"" Barshak (Gambit Captain) - said that ""they may face some problems"" but did not say anything particular

Yaroslav ""NS' Kuznetcov (CIS analyst) - ""this black line next to tha cursor is a replay bug. I don't have it, and cheating software does notaffect the replay. Secondly, the guy spent a ton of time training the creep block, and that is not ht eonly thing he is good at in game""

Dmitriy ""Korben"" Belov (Empire manager) - ""Our whole office is laughing. Thanks for hyping on this topic and raising our midlaners self-esteem""

Georgy DrAmer Faleev (Vega Sports Director) called PGG the ""king of 322"" and said that ""Instead of accusing young talents of cheating, PGG should speak out about his oun past performance as a player"". Without firther proof, DrAmer said that he heard from more that 10 people of how corrupted the StarSeries was at some point and how PGG was directly involved in it. ""The worst"", he sais"" is that the big names in CIS Dota are aware of that past of CIS community, and would follow the hate towards Kodos, instead of looking at their own mistakes in the past""

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? It is clear that there is no chating for you, or you think it definetely requires more attention from MDL and Valve?

I‚Äôve made a video looking at OG‚Äôs performance in the MDL Disneyland Paris Major closed qualifiers, and their match-ups with Secret, Liquid and TFT. With Ana returning, there was always going to be a lot of scrutiny over the team and whether they can gel again. And would Ana be able to compete at this level after a 4-month break from the team?

Yes I called the video ‚ÄúOG:Back in a Major way‚Äù, and maybe some people will think it‚Äôs too soon to say they‚Äôre back. But I think I saw some signs of a return to form from the green team, and I‚Äôm checking now to see where I can buy a shirt to show my support in Paris.

**Obsidian Destroyer, Forgemaster of Aziyog** is a melee strength hero who lives  deep below the surface of the world lay unknown wonders and horrors. Down and down again, well beneath the slithering magma fields and simmering roots of dormant volcanoes stands the obsidian city of Aziyog, its incomparable stonework spanning an endless cavern. Within honeycomb walls mortared with the bones of countless slaves lies the domain of the Abyssal Horde, and their monstrous golem forgemaster.

___


- Creator of Abyssal Blade

- Rumor has it that Obsidian Destroyer was responsible of Petrified City of Saraddel

- Some people might feel like the name is familiar

- Best friends forever with Underlord

- Is he destroyer made from obsidian or destroying obsidian?

- Has a second job as an outhouse decorator

**Q - MAGMA TORRENT**

*Obsidian Destroyer smashes the ground causing a rising magma torrent that, after a delay, knockbacks enemies, sends them into the air and deals magical damage.*

Closest comparison  is Kunkka's Torrent. This one displaces the enemy though. Would likely have a bigger delay than Kunkka. Knockback direction would be vector targeted.

Damage: 90/160/230/300

___

**GAMEPLAY PATTERN**

Durable and immobile crowd control hero suffering from somewhat long cooldowns and slow farming. Likes to build tanky auras. Could use Rod of Atos to set up Magma Torrent.

Spell combination: 

Use Unstoppable Force to run at enemy without resistance. Overwhelming Bash them. Then use Magma Torrent trying to predict where enemy will escape and immediately after start channeling your ultimate, Shards of Destruction. Hopefully Magma Torrent hits and sends enemy towards you allowing for a longer channeled ultimate before enemy escapes.

Another combination:

Gap close using Magma Torrent, then Overwhelming Bash them and start channeling ult. Unstoppable Force allows you to channel ultimate without interruption.

**APPEARANCE**

Spiky, bulky golem wielding a massive forgehammer.

Alternatively do something else to distinguish him more from being a black Tiny. Could be more monstrous like Underlord, sleek alien type like Outworld Devourer or use more Smithing references.

1051,Is Building Heart on Meepo Worth it?,"I‚Äôm still fairly new, and from what I know, heart makes meepo more tanky, but, if the passive doesn‚Äôt affect clones, is it still worth it? Do the stats really help meepo survive that much? Or is it better to just get skardi ?",DotA2

1. If I first press Q, it will execute the skill but if I double press it or press the 2nd time, it will cancel it. So you don't have to press S. Same as to W,E,and,D. There is an alias for this I think.
2. If I press A, it will attack automatically on the ground like a hotkey, don't have to press leftmousebutton and attack nearest hero or enemy in the mouse pointer. It should work like a  hotkey so you dont have to keep pressing leftmousebutton. Or if this is not possible, just make it same like my rightmouseclickbutton/same value for my ""A"" key and ""Rightmouseclick"" button. I'm using force attack too.
3. Make my tp key a hotkey. Since the new patch, there is a new tp key for tp in the 7th slot. Can you make it a hotkey. My key for tp is ""V"".

I remember a game where we tried to kill him, we were 2 cores followed him half the map to revenge and kill him, guess what happend!? Didnt kill, wasted time, and one of us end up dying... 
The hero is so tilting for enemy... and the problem is that no one is playin to counter him... i mean, in pickin phase if they go for oracle and some strong carry u are thinking about countering the core, u dont give a shit ab oracle pick, and end up losing cuz u ignored him.
What do u do vs Oracle?! U counter him? Focus him ? Ignore him?

1077,Signups for Redditors Dota 2 League EU Season 17 are now open!,"RD2L is kicking off its 17th Season! Season 17 runs from mid April until late June, with signups ending on April 13th.

**What is RD2L?**
--------------

The Redditors' Dota 2 League (RD2L) is a casual and competitive league for individual players (not teams) of all skill levels. It's a great way to experience organized and competitive Dota 2 without the heavy time commitments and scheduling uncertainty involved in forming a team for a typical league.

You can sign up as either a captain or a player. All players are placed in a draft pool from which captains will pick to form teams. You‚Äôll likely be placed with a team of people you haven‚Äôt met before, and will have the chance to make new friends as you practice and play together. After teams are drafted, they will play a 6 week group stage with one Captains Mode BO2 series each week, ending in a playoff for the top teams of each division.

  

**Why Play RD2L?**
--------------
   
*  **All skill levels welcome!** - While the average MMR in RD2L is high 3k - low 4k, we have players from 1k - 6k in the league. More experienced players can improve their teamwork, communication, and leadership skills while helping the lower MMR players improve their game skills.
*  **Balanced matches** - By drafting teams (similar to fantasy football), teams tend to be generally even in overall player skill. Additionally, regular season matchmaking pits teams with similar records up against each other each week to avoid unbalanced matchups.
* **A great way to build a stack** - Through inhouses and regular season matches, build a group of friends to stack and queue with. Teams made up of RD2L players regularly play in Battle Cups, AD2L, Valve Event Qualifiers and other events.
* **Develop your captaining and leadership skills** - Whether you captain this season or are mentored by one, RD2L is a great place to improve at CM. Drafting, strategy, and team play are all much more important than your average ranked pub game.
* **Make new friends** - We have hundreds of players each season, which means that you‚Äôll have a chance to meet people looking to have fun in a competitive setting like you. If you‚Äôre looking to meet more people to play Dota with this is a great league to get started in.
* **No scheduling hassles** - In our league you sign up for a division that plays its games on the same night every week. You‚Äôll know what night you need to play and won‚Äôt be scrambling to coordinate a match with your opponents.

**Signing up**
--------------
[Captain and Player Sign-Ups](https://eu.rd2l.gg/signup) and Information: For full information on how to sign up and rule changes from our previous season, see this post on our subreddit.


Captains get to draft players and run their team. If you wish to captain and this is your first season, you must be Legend or above and you must be approved by an admin vouch.

Players sign up to be drafted into a team. To sign up as a player you must have played at least 500 games and have 250 wins. Your Steam profile / Dota match data  must also be public to successfully sign up, and you are expected to keep it public for the duration of the season. There is no minimum MMR for players.

Sign-ups work on a first come first serve basis. The number of players we can support each season is limited by the number of captains that sign up, so being a captain is the best way to ensure you get a spot. (However, we typically ask for volunteers from returning players and previous captains if more are needed after sign-ups end, so don't feel pressure to sign-up as a captain.) If, as a player, you go undrafted, you can still be added to a team that needs you during the season as a Free Agent.

In Season 17, the Wednesday division will continue with 6-player teams, while the Sunday division will, for the first time, have teams consisting of 5 players (1 captain + 4 drafted players).

If you're having signup issues, you can send us a modmail on our subreddit, PM me here on reddit, or come to [our discord](https://discord.gg/6nVQ2QT) and ask an administrator for assistance there.

**Season 17 Schedule**
--------------


 | WED | SUN
|---|---|---
Draft Day | April 17th | April 21st
Group Stage | April 24th - May 29th | April 28th - June 2nd
Playoffs (Top 8 Teams)| June 5th - June 19th | June 9th - June 16th
Playoffs might be extended by one week (Top 16 teams), depending on number of signups. 




**Divisions**
--------------
When you sign up, you will choose a division for a day/time where you'll be regularly available. For the entire regular season, your matches will start at the same time on the same night of the week! For example, the CET-SUN division plays every Sunday on Luxembourg Servers at 19:30 CET.

Divisions list:

Match Time | Server | Days
----------|:------:|----
20:30 CEST | EU West | Wednesday
19:30 CEST | EU West | Sunday



You may sign up for both CET-Wednesday and CET-Sunday if you wish. Please be aware that signing up for multiple divisions is not an invitation to pick one that you prefer and quit the other - quitting an RD2L team typically results in expulsion from the league.

Communication will be done via discord only. If you have any questions, you can always send me a PM via reddit or find me in Discord and PM me there. Our discord is full of active and friendly community members that can help with any confusion.

Thanks, we hope you enjoy the season.

1117,What's going on with the DPC standings?,"*TL, DR: Someone needs to be in better control of the official DPC standings and clarify some of the rules because right now it's confusing and unprofessional especially for teams possibly fighting for the last few spots to TI and we should not have to risk arguing the exact standings after all tournaments have been played.*

Checking out the DPC standings after the surprise qualifications of TEAM TEAM, complexity, Team Empire and Pain Gaming to the Disneyland Paris Major there are some things about the way DPC points are handled I personally find deeply unprofessional and would like to discuss.

First and foremost, the fact that the DPC standings on Liquipedia and especially the official site are not properly updated for all teams is a big problem. Last year with dozens of tournaments, I could kind of understand but this year, there really is no excuse. Some examples:

* Thunder Predator has 150 points on Liquipedia and (correctly) 120 on the official site. **1-0 Valve**

* Test123 is still at 120 points on Liquipedia but since they were PainX when they got those points and points stay with organizations, the official site has removed them. **2-0 Valve**

* Old but Gold has 90 points on the official site but there was no third place decider in that tournament and both them and Flying Penguins got 80 points as Liquipedia says. **2-1 Valve**

* Flying Penguins got 80 points but released three players in mid march and another five players (disband) on March 23rd. Since even a disband theoretically doesn't remove all points (it seems to be always calculated by 20% of the remaining total per player), I'm not even sure about the math here but my calculator says getting 80 points and removing seven players results in 16,777 points. Who knew? Valve has them at 22, Liquipedia at 51,2. **2-1-1 Valve**

* If Flying Penguins is in, why was PainX removed and isn't sitting on 49,152 points? **2-1-2 Draw**

* Team Tigers won 120 points by winning the first freaking Minor and then dropped four players over the season. For some reason, they are not on the official leaderboard. Liquipedia has them on 61,44 points for three removals. Since only three point-winning players were replaced (but a fourth in Mushi added and then removed without adding points to the team), it's unclear to me whether this or my personal calculation of 49,152 points is correct. **2-1-2-1 Draw**

* RNG took 54 points (90 with sub), then replaced 343 with September. They then played with Flyby and Mad for Setsu and September for a while, didn't take any points but qualified with that squad to the Starladder Minor. Again unclear, whether this should be penalized and if so how heavily since only Setsu was in the point-winning squad at the time. To the Starladder Minor they showed up with Lanm instead of Mad and took 20 points. Was Lanm a third replacement? Was he a sub? Both? Liquipedia has them on 54,56 points, Valve at 43. Since I'm a hardliner I put them on 31,7184 points but don't even ask me how I got there. **2-1-2-2 Draw**

* Playmakers Esports/Team Odd/Demolition Boys: I have already spend 2 hours on this post. They switched players, switched orgs, took some points. Who the fuck knows. Valve puts them at 19 points, Liquipedia at 52,8. My experience after looking into this for a while makes me think both these numbers are wrong. **2-1-2-3 Who knows**

* TEAM TEAM took 40 points but has since replaced Ryoya and Sammyboy with EE and Gunnar. They should be at 25,6 points but Liquipedia says 40 and the official site doesn't list them at all. **2-1-3-3 Everybody loses**

* ROONS and Vega and possibly others are also unclear but I think I made my point

In conclusion, Valve should clean up this mess. Someone should remember to update the standings of all points holders after at least every official Valve sponsored event. Also, the rules should be much clearer and accessible to everyone on their homepage (i.e. in the at this point ridiculously short and unclear FAQ section). I'm sure I could have found more information on it and I'm 99% positive I made mistakes in my calculations or understanding on how the whole system works but that is kind of the point: 

The whole DPC system is completely byzantine right now and I didn't even go into the whole sub thing (Miracle-shadow), visa issues and whether or not the power of organizations has become too great to the point that they could blackmail players with their DPC points and/or sit out half the season without much consequence so long as they pick up a good squad that is going to the last Major (a la mouz historically or currently Pain).

I know Valve has a more ""we will deal with it if it becomes a problem"" approach so maybe I should just take a chill pill. Considering the money on the line though, I feel it's kind of wrong to leave these questions unanswered for now and deal with it later. And before you rush to the conclusion that I'm insane and a few points are completely meaningless, look at this current scenario: TEAM TEAM is going to Disneyland, EHOME (12th) isn't. Let's assume EHOME doesn't make it to the Minor either and TEAM TEAM scores a surprising 7th/8th. According to Valve, EHOME would be 12th on 489 points and tt 13th on 450. Liquipedia would put tt 12th with 490 points though. In reality, they'd be sitting on 475,6.

Now imagine a similar scenario at the last Major and with a constellation involving RNG or Demolition Boys.",DotA2

1119,Game-throwing bug with gem and courier,"Hey there everyone

So i was watching this game where the lion had bought a gem + 2 other items and tried to deliver it on a courier which already had 4 of its slots occupied, the exact second the courier tried to take the items from this lion's stash it picked up the 2 other items (which were consumables, wards and a tome of xp) and insta-delivered the gem to the place lion was at because (i think) it prioritized the consumables over gem and since gem can't be put into backpack it just got insta-delivered to lion, here's the [dotabuff](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/4605248822) link for the match and the match id is **4605248822**, time stamps for all this are min 30:06 when lion bought the items and min 30:35 when the courier tries to deliver the items.

I'm sure this bug has also happened to me as well and i think it might've been already reported on reddit too, hope someone at valve (the janitor) notices this and fixes it for the next patch because some players might not notice this and would just feed a gem for free and get fucked for it.",DotA2

I've just started playing again and am having severe FPS issues. My fps has historically been 40-50, which I have no issue with. However, during a game I'm now 30-50, and during any kind of fight, it drops to 10-20 pretty consistently, which is unplayable for me. I play on the minimum possible graphics settings, with the suggested resolution (3860/2160 or something like that). I tried going to a lower resolution with the same minimum settings, and that shot my fps up to 100, but the entire game was blurry as all hell and unplayable.


I have a Toshiba laptop, 15in. Intel Core i7 6500u @ 2.50 gHz. 16gb RAM, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 950M. I truly have no idea, but shouldn't I be getting better than 10-20 fps during fights with this computer?

#Notes:
~~I'm aware that ""Status Resistance Reduction"" is a horribly clunky phrase, but it's already in use for Enfeeble, so I went with it.~~ Arcane Supremacy uses the more clear ""Debuff Duration Amplification"" keyword; thanks to /u/weebAnnihilator [(source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/b8kmsz/_/ejzdrp4)

For clarity: the first time you cast a spell after using Caduceus, it deals 25% more damage (if it deals any) and its debuff lasts 25% longer (if it has any). **EDIT:** Additionally, because this wasn't clear from the original post, **Spell Amplification and Status Resistance Reduction values return to their passive values once the buff ends.** *This really only applies to spells that last for longer than 4 seconds, and I'm pretty sure that changes in Status Resistance do not alter the duration of already-applied Status Effects.*

Make no mistake; this is meant to be more of an upgrade to Ghost Scepter than an upgrade to Kaya.

I considered making this basically an Ethereal Blade that gives fewer stats, costs less, doesn't slow or damage on-hit, and reduces Status Resistance as well as Magic Damage Resistance when cast on enemies, but I felt that a cheaper E-Blade with built-in SpellAmp might be a bit much (not that I'm convinced *this* is perfectly-balanced, either).

To be honest, it kinda feels like Ethereal forms should already amplify status effects on their own; I always liked the lore-as-mechanic aspect of physical beings having a base level of magic resistance, and of having to give up that innate resistance to remove yourself from the physical realm‚Äîand, in so doing, remove yourself also from the threat of physical harm. It feels like a natural extension of that reasoning to also say that spells' effects will linger for a longer time.... but then again, I hated that experiment with Brewmaster and ""elemental damage"", so maybe it's for the best.

Here's an [alternate icon](https://i.imgur.com/OE4I3Vs.png) that attempts to reference Ghost Scepter more in its design; I didn't like this one as much, as it felt too cluttered (and the icons are displayed at half their size in-game, so the wisps of... ectoplasm? coming out of the snakes' eyes would be almost impossible to see).",DotA2

1164,"Scandal in CIS community: Kodos, Team Empire midlaner accused of cheating in the Major Qualifiers finals","I haven't seen any posts on it yet, however the topic is pretty contraversial. 

# What happened? 

It started with the CIS caster and analyst PGG claiming that he [noticed the signs of cheating](https://clips.twitch.tv/CautiousCrepuscularLemur4Head) in the Team Empire - Na'Vi match. He claimed that Kodos, the midlaner of Team Empire, used cheating software to block the creeps because of too much APM and the ""suspitious black line"" next to the cursor. Team Empire manager Korben and CIS caster 4ce argued PGGs claim. 

V1lat asked pro players and analysts to check out the moment of blocking creeps in more details, and he described the overall reaction as  ""Almost ideal blocking, which currently can be seen only from Open AI bots""

# Further suspitions:

After the hype was brought up, CIS community noticed other moments, which at least require a closer look. 

1) No aim Euls

*Processing video 01ygprrgl3q21...*

2) Item Drop 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing video kj847gsnl3q21...*

I don't want to accuse anyone too early and I think it definetely requires an investigation , I'll just leave those clips for you to decide whether cheating took place their or not. 

# Media Reaction

Ilya ""Illidan"" Pivcaev about the creep block - ""it is a regular bind you can set up in 2 seconds, it is not APM or something forbidden. 

Nikita ""4ce"" Kotkov claimed that Kodos clicked Euls on Axe before he jumped, so when the distance got broken by Axe's blink, the Eul got activated

Artem ""fng"" Barshak (Gambit Captain) - said that ""they may face some problems"" but did not say anything particular

Yaroslav ""NS' Kuznetcov (CIS analyst) - ""this black line next to tha cursor is a replay bug. I don't have it, and cheating software does notaffect the replay. Secondly, the guy spent a ton of time training the creep block, and that is not ht eonly thing he is good at in game""

Dmitriy ""Korben"" Belov (Empire manager) - ""Our whole office is laughing. Thanks for hyping on this topic and raising our midlaners self-esteem""

Georgy DrAmer Faleev (Vega Sports Director) called PGG the ""king of 322"" and said that ""Instead of accusing young talents of cheating, PGG should speak out about his oun past performance as a player"". Without firther proof, DrAmer said that he heard from more that 10 people of how corrupted the StarSeries was at some point and how PGG was directly involved in it. ""The worst"", he sais"" is that the big names in CIS Dota are aware of that past of CIS community, and would follow the hate towards Kodos, instead of looking at their own mistakes in the past""

&amp;#x200B;

I mute all the gamer ruiners and players who are either really bad or so toxic they are purposely ruining the game for the team.

&amp;#x200B;

A large portion of my games contain 1-3 pre muted players. Obviously rare occasions no pre mutes, or maybe even 4 pre mutes.

  
The thing I've noticed the MOST is that they are always on my team. Everytime I see 3 pre mutes, they all happen to be on my team. I'm curious how that is even remotely fair. Valve needs a system like overwatch where you have an option to ""Avoid this player"". So if I have avoid this player set to 3 of my teammates maybe only give me one of those idiots and not all 3.

I just reviewed the replay and I found out that his teammate pudge was actually the one hacking as he was pinging his teammates especially huskar who he was in a party with my location. You can actually see it in the mini map that he accurately pinpoints my location despite not having any wards in the area. If you guys want to check it out the match id is ""4606617118"".

The problem is when we got to the 4k bracket (Ancient rank) i didnt see a reason to continue tryharding in party q as the peak we can get is ancient 7.
And now when i started playing solo q in 2.7 bracket playing pos 3 as usually, im finding myself unable to carry the game from my pos, wrecking the safelane carry the first 10 mins, being top networth for the first 20 mins (sometimes the entire game), and still losing the game at the end.
I would like to ask people who have been at my place, what was their recipe to solve this problem, because it is really frustrating losing in a 2k bracket when i have been playing occasionally against rank 4k immortals in 4k brackets.",DotA2

1227,About the GSL Format,"First, a rant about GSL. If you lose your first series, there's no way you can top your group. Also if Team A beats Team C in their first series, loses against Team B (that won vs D), and then loses against Team C (that won vs D), they get placed lower than Team C despite being 1-1 h2h with team C. 

The 1-2 and 2-3 seeding matters quite a bit because in the first case, it could be the difference between facing Secret and a lesser team in upper bracket. In the second case, it could mean getting sent to the lower bracket for a Bo1 elimination because you lost the second series and won the first instead of the other way round.

Why is it that we don't see round-robin to truly gauge the seeding of the teams? It only takes one more series per group (of 4) with h2h as tiebreaker. Since they are held simultaneously, it extends the day by about 3h for a 2-1 series, and you could play 3 series a day over 2 or 4 days depending on how many groups you wanna run simultaneously.

I can understand the need for such formats due to time constraints but 6 vs 5 series isn't much of a difference to justify a shitty format.",DotA2

Participation includes completing the following 10 minute-long survey:

[https://kent.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_4MGKu2YRRDSdQtn](https://kent.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4MGKu2YRRDSdQtn)

Questions span game habits, empathy and addiction scales, and exposure to toxic behaviors. The targeted pool is adult DOTA2 players (18+), feel free to share this invitation with who may satisfy this criterion.

If you would like additional information about this study, please contact me at [egandol1@kent.edu](mailto:egandol1@kent.edu).

1260,Immortal Rank Meta Trends - a week into 7.21d,"Spectral guy here. Yet another first-week-report. There is also NADCL Season 3 post in works. Not sure about major qualifiers, let me know if you're interested.

This post is based on data collected during the first week of patch 7.21d. This report includes not only ranked data, but stats of all matches with average rank equal to Immortal. Excluded matches are the ones that had abandons, ended in less than 10 minutes or had insignificantly low score (or it was impossible to get detailed draft data for them).

Positions data may be inaccurate in some way (mostly so that very bad core games are counted as support while supports who had high stats and didn't spent much on support items may be considered core), but it's most likely to be insignificant.

There's something off about draft stages at the moment, just ignore it for now.

[Full report is available here](https://spectralalliance.ru/reports/?league=imm_ranked_721d). You can look through data by yourself if you want, maybe you'll find something interesting as well. There are more detailed data about Hero VS Hero performance, Draft stages priorities, pairs and trios, positions stats and dire/radiant winrates, Meta Graph and region specific data. The report will be updated semi-weekly (sort of).

# Short FAQ

* **Why so little matches played in REGION NAME?** On higher ranks it's common to queue for game on closest popular region. I.e. EUW for RU players, USE for USW.
* **Where did you get data?** I've got match IDs manually extracted from leaderboards players' recent matches using STRATZ API. Then I fetch match data using mostly OpenDota API.
* **Why there are only random draft matches played in China?** They just like playing random draft ever since DotA All-Stars days.
* **What does banned winrate mean?** It's winrate of a player (and his team) who nominated a hero for ban.
* **Can I see individual players stats somewhere?** Techically - yes. But there are too much players, reports are getting too big and unreadable because of that. Also privacy stuff.
* **What is Hero Pairs Divergence?** It's the difference between expected pair's matches and real match number. Usually this difference is higher for better hero combos.
* **What is Hero Rank?** Think of it as of smart winrate sort. It considers popularity and winrate of heroes.
* **Is it strictly Immortal Rank?** Not for now, there may be some random individual divine players here and there. Altho, an ""Immortal Rank"" match is usually the match with at least 9 immortal players in it.

1315,"Piece Discussion of the Day: Pawn (April 1st, 2019)","##**Pawn**

The pawn (‚ôô,‚ôü) is the most numerous [piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece) in the game of [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess), and in most circumstances, also the weakest. It historically represents [infantry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry), or more particularly, armed [peasants](/r/leagueoflegends) or [pikemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikemen). Each player begins a game with eight pawns, one on each square of the [rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#rank) immediately in front of the other pieces. (The white pawns start on a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2; the black pawns start on a7, b7, c7, d7. e7, f7, g7, h7.)

Individual pawns are referred to by the [file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#file) on which they stand. For example, one speaks of ""White's f-pawn"" or ""Black's b-pawn"". Alternatively, they can be referred to by the piece which stood on that file at the beginning of the game, e.g. ""White's king bishop's pawn"" or ""Black's queen knight's pawn"". It is also common to refer to a [rook's pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#rook's_pawn), meaning any pawn on the a- or h-files, a [knight's pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#knight's_pawn) (on the b- or g-files), a [bishop's pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#bishop's_pawn) (on the c- or f-files), a [queen's pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#queen's_pawn) (on the d-file), a [king's pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#king's_pawn) (on the e-file), and a [central pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#central_pawn) (on the d- or e-files).

_The pawn is the soul of chess. ... the Pawns. They are the very Life of the Game. They alone form the Attack and the Defense; on their good or bad Situation depends the Gain or Loss of the Party. - [Fran√ßois-Andr√© Danican Philidor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-Andr%C3%A9_Danican_Philidor)_

---

##**Roles:** Infantry

##**Movement**

Pawns move differently than other pieces. Unlike all the other pieces, pawns can not move backwards. Most of the time, a pawn moves by going up a single square, but the first time each pawn is moved from its starting place, it can go forward two squares. Pawns may not use the first two-square move to jump over a square with another piece on it or to capture. Any piece in front of a pawn, white or black, stops its moving.

**Capturing**

Unlike other pieces, the pawn does not capture in the same direction that it moves. A pawn captures diagonally forward one square to the left or right.

Another unusual rule is the [en passant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant) capture. It can occur after a pawn advances two squares using its initial two-step move option, and the square passed over is attacked by an enemy pawn. The enemy pawn is entitled to capture the moved pawn ""in passing"" ‚Äì as if it had advanced only one square. The capturing pawn moves to the square over which the moved pawn passed (see diagram), and the moved pawn is removed from the board. The option to capture the moved pawn en passant must be exercised on the move immediately following the double-step pawn advance, or it is lost for the remainder of the game.

En passant was added in the 15th century to compensate for the then newly added two-square initial move rule (Hooper &amp; Whyld 1992:124). Without en passant, a pawn on its initial square could safely bypass a square controlled by an advanced enemy pawn.

**Promotion**

A pawn that advances all the way to the opposite side of the board (the opposing player's first rank) is [promoted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(chess\)) to another piece of that player's choice: a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. The pawn is immediately (before the opponent's next move) replaced by the new piece. Since it is uncommon for a piece other than a queen to be chosen, promotion is often called ""queening"". When some other piece is chosen it is known as [underpromotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underpromotion). The piece most often selected for underpromotion is a [knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_(chess\)), used to execute a [checkmate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkmate) or a [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(chess\)) to gain a significant net increase in material. Underpromotion is also used in situations where promoting to a queen would give immediate [stalemate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalemate). The choice of promotion is not limited to pieces that have been captured; thus a player could in theory have as many as ten knights, ten bishops, ten rooks or nine queens on the board simultaneously. While this extreme would almost never occur in practice, in game 11 of their 1927 world championship match, [Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ra%C3%BAl_Capablanca) and [Alexander Alekhine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Alekhine) each had two queens in play from move 65 through move 66. While some finer sets do include an extra queen of each color, most standard chess sets do not come with additional pieces, so the physical piece used to replace a promoted pawn on the board is usually one that was previously captured. When the correct piece is not available, some substitute is used: a second queen is often indicated by inverting a previously captured rook, or a piece is borrowed from another set.

##**Strategy**

**Isolated pawn**

Pawns on adjacent files can support each other in attack and defense. A pawn which has no friendly pawns in adjacent files is an [isolated pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_pawn). The square in front of an isolated pawn may become an enduring weakness. Any piece placed directly in front not only blocks the advance of that pawn, but cannot be driven away by other pawns.

**Passed pawn**

A pawn which cannot be blocked or captured by enemy pawns in its advance to promotion is a [passed pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passed_pawn). In the diagram, White has a protected passed pawn on c5 and Black has an outside passed pawn on h5. Because endgames are often won by the player who can promote a pawn first, having a passed pawn in an endgame can be decisive ‚Äì especially a protected passed pawn (a passed pawn that is protected by a pawn). In this vein, a pawn majority, a greater number of pawns belonging to one player on one side of the chessboard, is strategically important because it can often be converted into a passed pawn.

**Doubled pawn**

After a capture with a pawn, a player may end up with two pawns on the same file, called [doubled pawns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubled_pawns). Doubled pawns are substantially weaker than pawns which are side by side, because they cannot defend each other, they usually cannot both be defended by adjacent pawns, and the front pawn blocks the advance of the back one.

There are situations where doubled pawns confer some advantage, typically when the guarding of consecutive squares in a file by the pawns prevents an invasion by the opponent's pieces.

Pawns which are both doubled and isolated are typically a tangible weakness. A single piece or pawn in front of doubled isolated pawns blocks both of them, and cannot be easily dislodged. It is rare for a player to have three pawns in a file, i.e. tripled pawns.

**Wrong rook pawn**

In chess endgames with a bishop, a [rook pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#rook_pawn) may be the [wrong rook pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrong_rook_pawn), depending on the square-color of the bishop. This causes some positions to be draws that would otherwise be wins.

Usually my posts are about how techies is overpowered and its because i only tell the truth :p but today i ask for wisdom about a career in casting. 

Ive been playing dota for 6 and a half years now and have fell in love with the game,  community and lore and techies.

Ive played in competitve teams and am very familiar with how different dota is in this setting espicially around ti time.

Aswell as playing competitivly throughout my esporrs career first with call of duty and dota i started shoutcasting matches for a quick laugh, attempting to motivate the players up in my ranked games to play the game, eventually i got better and better and learnt shoutcasting techniques to apply to these short moments eventually (over the years) sounding more and more like the casters you hear today. 

Ive had a ton of people tell me they love my casting and alot more peoole saying i should become a caster 

Ive shoutcasted many scrims on my stream and also shoutcasted for dota lans but i cant seem to find the next step on how to pursue this dream. What do i do reddit,  its really hard to be seen. 

I need your help reddit as soon as possibly so i wont forget it, because as much as i enioy casting  i could never do it for ever lasting, as like everyone, we gotta pay the bills in order to live a little closer to holly wood hills

As we saw in the European Individual Championship (from Skopje), the US Chess Champion Ship (St. Louis, USA) &amp; Sharjah Masters (UEA) - it seems like Queen's remain the top piece-to-beat with 54.6% winrate after move 30 on both black &amp; white (insane factional statistics!).

In the still-ongoing  Vugar Gashimov Memorial Shamkir Tournament (live from Azerbaijan) we saw something interesting as the normalized pawn value decreased below 0.97 for the first time in 2 years of competitive events. Both Stockfish and Houdini initially felt there were inaccuracies being made but upon review (and with more processing time), they confirmed the valuation. The second-order pawn function also was at it's flattest in 6 years - but part of this is due to the low base values.

As we saw in the Tata Steel Chess Open, the **synergy** value of **double-Bishop** vs Bishop+Knight in the midgame proved to be too strong, +0.3 at the minimum and a whopping +0.64 average gain. **e4** made significant losses at the event, but when adjusting for Elo the effect was lessened (to within one error deviation).

While becoming really great at chess is difficult, it is surprisingly easy to learn enough about chess to feel like you're playing it ""correctly.""

John is one of the most clear headed youtube personalities and he is very eloquent in his manner of explaining why he does things. 
I recommend watching his ""Chess Fundamentals"" play list, and then follow up with a few of his videos in the ""climbing the rating ladder"" video list.

1363,Bad booster physically ill... Damaged.,"I had a match last night in my bracket ancinet 7, eu server, with a player who said that he is booster, claimed his main is 6k. He first pick Alchemist pos 4, i was mid ember, we had jakiro offlane and FV with enigma safe.
The funny thing is that this guy had open mic and talked waaaaay too much, indian accent, and i can swear he was a psycho. Here why... he said "" i go ags first, for u void for u"" then he build radiance and said after radi goes ags, after radi went manta and said after... and so one... till he stared to take all farm, going mental, when me or fv tried to farm lane or jungle he stared to scream.. Like rly loud and i tought he is having a seizure, let him farm... he was BIPOLAR, after scream, he talked rly slow and apologised, was so forgiving, this behaviour repeting all game.
Anyway, from the strat till end, he was positive, even when we lost fights he said is ok is ok we win... at some point he started flaming fv for bad cronos and nigma... 
He was smth like this "" FUCK UUUUU, FUCK MEEEE, MEEE FUCK MEE"", apologised after and this lasted all the mid late game... 
I laughed all game.. Had tears in my eyes, rarely could do the ember combos... was super funny...
This was my last game for last badge on ember. Master Ember Spirit. Always be remembered.
Wanted to share with u guys. 
I feel sorry for indian guy Alche, i think dota broke his mind.

Ps: we won, alche did share some ags, but late late game... and i rly dont think he was 6k on main, maybe 5k max.

1385,Social media development for smaller teams,"Greetings, friends! April 1st is probably not the best day to post a semi-serious thread, but here-goes.

I'm about to graduate from college with a degree in visual communications (short for photo, video, graphic design and web design) and I need to beef up the graphic design portion of my portfolio. 

I could do the graphics on anything but I've always been very interested in dota teams and their branding on social media. I have experience in brand cohesiveness for myself and some friends that heavily use socials as well but would love to potentially help some smaller dota teams make their brands more concise. 

In today's scene, a strong visual presence online can make a huge difference in regard to cultivating a fanbase, and strong branding for social media outlets can help that process along.

Recent example of my work: https://imgur.com/a/DVGrsMT 

TL;DR: if you're part of or know of a smaller dota team that would like some new channel/social art, give me the name of the team, a link to any sort of social media the team has (or a leader), a little mission statement (if applicable), and what sort of art you're interested in (youtube art? twitter banners? facebook graphics? etc). And maybe consider throwing me an upvote so I can reach more people. Because you're going out on a limb to trust me, I obviously don't need to be paid. Getting work for my portfolio is enough for me and being able to say that an actual team uses my work is a major bonus, so it's in my best interest to make you happy and give you a product you're satisfied with.

* Reinstalling Dota2 and Steam
* Completely removed Dota2 and Steam files (Uninstalling and deleting Registerey and any local files) and installed everything again
* Tried to open the game from the bin folder (Win32/Win64)
* Changed Steam download server
* Tried different accounts

1425,Stream Sniping and Blocking the Mini-Map,"Watching DotA streams on Twitch is something most of us have indulged in at some point. A lot of us regularly see streamers hide/cover their mini map owing to alleged stream sniping. As a viewer, my level of enjoyment and following the game goes down significantly when watching a game with a blocked mini-map versus not. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Why do streamers hide it in the first place?*   
The most common response you get from streamers and viewers is ""not having wards"". The most common mini-map overlay are the ones with most of the possible wards spots already in place and a translucent background to cover hero icons and wards. Streamers feel like stream sniping is solely the reason they might be losing the game and blocking the mini-map both deters people from &amp; combats stream-sniping. For people whose livelihood depends on streaming they will take the steps they deem necessary to win the games and make the stream more enjoyable. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Does it work?*  
Stream-sniping definitely exists, but probably not as rampant as a lot of streamers/viewers project it to be. The truth is, you can never really be sure if something in a game happened because of them sniping the stream or superior game sense. There are very few circumstances a streamer can absolutely be sure that the enemy team's actions are because of them streaming sniping the game.  

An example: Any non-cliff eye ward getting dewarded is more often than not attributed to stream sniping when the mini-map is not covered; and not to the enemy supports being competent at dewarding by either spotting/game sense/sentry spamming. 

Any person that has decided to stream snipe a game to gain an unfair advantage; will probably not stop simply because the streamer blocked the mini-map. He can still see the gameplay and/or hear their calls. The only reason why a sniper will stop is due to stream delays; which is usually the most common thing streamers do during tournament games. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Why not stream with a delay then?*

Because streamers think this takes away the ""live stream"" aspect of their product and reduces their interaction with their viewers/chat and makes it less friendly for viewers to continue watching. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Watching a stream with a blocked mini-map isn't the same as being able to see the mini-map.* 

As a viewer; my experience and enjoyment drastically goes down when the stream has a blocked mini-map. The mini-map gives way too much valuable information that helps you connect the dots and enhances the viewing experience exponentially. Being able to look at the mini-map; look at wards, allies' movements, enemies showing or not; are simply not substitutable. Hopping into a stream mid game is very different when the mini-map is blocked. Not being able to determine where the lanes are, how many towers are standing, wards, etc are all not ascertained by a viewer right away; but they are when they stream has an open mini-map. 

Streamers block their mini-map in order to give them a better chance to win so that viewers have more fun; but are directly crippling the viewer experience. Of course streams can still be enjoyed with a blocked mini-map; but there is absolutely no way the same stream will not be MORE enjoyable with the mini-map visible. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Does covering the mini-map actually work towards achieving its goal? You can never be sure if you're being stream sniped or not; with both a blocked and a visible mini-map. But blocking the mini-map surely does work towards lowering the viewing experience.**   


I have often bought this up in streams where the streamer blocks the mini-map. Loyal subs will usually respond by saying something along the lines of watching all your wards getting dewarded or losing the game is not very fun. Again, that can not be truly be ascertained or attributed to stream sniping; but decreased viewing experience is stating the obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

BSJ once said the reason he blocks the mini-map is coz you can never be sure why your smoke ganks are being caught or why you're being dewarded when the mini-map is visible; but you can be fairly sure it is not due to sniping when blocked.  It is a sense of uncertainty you have as to why your strategy is not working when the mini-map is not blocked; and that insecurity is nullified to some extent when they block the mini-map. 

&amp;#x200B;

When Matumbaman was asked by his chat why he won't block his mini-map he said the same thing this post is trying to. He said something like ""Watching a stream with a blocked mini-map is no fun. I will never watch one; so why will I expect yo guys to watch mine. A mini-map is essential in watching a dota stream"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Thats my two cents on the topic and I'm merely discussing the topic. People whose livelihood depends on their streams are welcome to do what they wish with their stream. My argument is that it decreases the viewing experience and makes me less likely to watch a stream with a blocked mini-map. Streamers ultimately stream for the viewers, and not to solely to win games. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR: Streamers blocking their mini-map due to (alleged) stream sniping drastically reduces their viewer's experience while not serving the purpose they do it for in the first place.**

1452,/r/Dota2 x Chess,"Hey Now, 

Over the last three months we have seen Dota Chess absolutely explode. It's been exciting to see a custom game take a path paralleling Dota. With Chess we have seen our active community numbers rise above one million concurrent players, a milestone we have not hit for many moons. We have also witnessed numerous tournaments featuring non Dota endemic streamers, bringing new faces and players into the game!

Admittedly, we feel that on /r/dota2 we haven‚Äôt fully embraced Dota Chess. While we continue to love Dota unconditionally, we don‚Äôt want to make an exclusionary community against those who are here for chess, or for those players who regularly play both games. We feel inclusion (in all regards) is of the utmost importance.

That is why today we‚Äôre embracing chess on the subreddit. Fully. We know that this is overdue, but we hope to welcome back in those players new and old to our subreddit.

As always, some of these updates are a work in progress. Any and all feedback is super appreciated.

If we accept that the minimum teams for each region is 2, it's obvious that NA is under-performing with the three slots. Also, we should consider that the extra slot gives more opportunities for free points (essentially you need to get a Bo1 and you get 150 points). On the other hand, 4 slots for a region is overkill (although CN has a very good case), so I would award the NA slot to SEA since they only have 2 right now, they are above NA in both tables and above CIS in the second table.

1457,Pangolier got buffed,"As a pango spammer I was really scared when I saw the latest patch, but after a few games I must say its not really tragic. While you can feel the slightly less proc chance on your right clicks, the ""only one debuff at a time"" acutally makes up for it. You can actually choose wheter you like your roll, or you wanna wait out for a new proc. (E.g. ez rosh with perma disarm with lvl 25 talent).

However I really feel buffed in matchup vs TB on lane. I used to constantly get screwed by his first who almost always got at least 4-5 right clicks. Now most of the time with the abyssmal dmg that pango has I hardly notice the reflection.

1488,Apply Bounty Hunter's old Jinada effect to Shadow Walk,"Jinada, when changed in 7.20, had its previous maim effect replaced with a midas-style one, which makes sense given its primary function of gold theft. Said maim effect was a nice one, however, and it feels like it should still be part of Bounty Hunter's kit somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

The attack that breaks Shadow Walk slows the target like Jinada used to, but has no visible effect for doing so. Applying the previous maim effect to Shadow Walk would be a nice way to signify the debuff without interfering with Jinada's new function.",DotA2
1489,Yet another Kaya upgrade idea,"Most of the Kaya upgrade ideas I have seen seem to make it even better for spell casters in a way, without giving much other utility and taking components with actives that it plays on. This is quite different from the designs of Halberd and Manta, both of which take another passive component and give ability which is not a direct buff to the heroes stat but is none the less desirable.

With that in mind, here is my Kaya upgrade idea: 

Item : 
Khatvanga

Cost : 
4050

Components : 
Kaya + Hyperstone

Disassemble? : 
Yes 

Stats : 
+20 int
12 % spell amp
+14 % mana reduction

Active : 
Oblivion - Target unit is shifted into another dimension for 1.5 seconds. Upon returning, it is dealt 150 magic damage if its an enemy.  

Mana cost : 100
Cooldown : 15 secs.

Idea : Right now dota lacks an item that can save allied heroes from initiation like blackhole or chronosphere or buy them just a few more moments before their skills/items are ready. This item fills that niche. It is also a good item for initiation or counter-initiation. There are a lot of int heroes that could use some attack speed and or save or both. Heroes like storm/od/techies/lina/qop would like the extra attack speed and kaya is also a useful item for most of them. It helps setup spells for some of them as well as provide a possible alternative to Euls if you don't need a purge. Its niche enough to be built on non-int heroes for potential save against necro ult/chrono/blackhole/axe call/duel that otherwise have no item counters.",DotA2

1507,i think Drow Strats are officially back.,"My main gripe with the changes to drow is how shit her base agility and her agility gain were. Its what prevented a good push strat ever being possible with Drow.

I even made a post complaining how garbage Drow felt.

But 7.21d has returned Drow Strats.

Now with 2 Wraith Bands, Treads on Agility and Hurricane Pike you basically give almost 2 Moonshards worth of attack speed. And since drow can flash farm so fast once she gets level 6, you can really start buffing your team mapwide.

With a meta of longer lasting games, Drow Strats really do bring a fresh air to the meta. As games end can end in 18-24 minutes if you stomp hard with the Drow Strat.

I feel 7.21d will be the big meta shift.

Funnily Viper still benefits from Drow Strat, and he has been nerfed twice already XD.

The noob trio can shine with this strat. Viper, Sniper and Drow can run a pretty effective Drow Strat.

It was fun, reminded me of the good ol days when i started Dota and Drow, Viper and Sniper popped in every game and i still had no idea what to play. And because the Drow stomped me i thought this hero was OP. It's good to revive the good ol days in actual ranked games XD.",DotA2

***Chess Patch History***

**Patch notes v1.3**

* Checkmate is now required to win. You can no longer win by capturing all pieces other than the King.

**Patch notes v1.4**

* Pawn buff: Pawns that reach the other side of the board can now be promoted to a Vizier, so they can move one diagonal step at a time.

*Developer note: We think pieces that can't move aren't fun, so we're giving the Pawn a bit of extra flexibility in the late game.*

**Patch notes v1.4.1**

* The Vizier has been replaced by the Queen: Queens can now move any number of spaces in all 8 directions, instead of just one diagonal step.
* Bishop buff! Bishops can move any number of spaces diagonally, instead of 2 spaces diagonally.

*Developer note: We wanted to open up the game in a more aggressive direction. We'll be monitoring gameplay and making adjustments as needed.*

**Patch notes v1.4.2**

* New King Ultimate Ability: Once per game, the King can make a knight's move or move two spaces in one direction.

*Developer note: We've heard some complaints about the Queen, calling us SJWs for making an OP female character, or complaining that promoting a pawn to a second Queen supports bigamy. Our only concern is to bring you the best game possible, and we have no plans to nerf the Queen.*

*However, the Queen and Bishop buffs in conjunction have make the King a bit too vulnerable in the center of the board, so we're buffing the King in response by giving it a one-time ult.*

* Pawns that reach the other side of the board can now be promoted to any piece, not just the Queen.

*Developer note: The Vizier to Queen change was a stealth buff to the Pawn. We're happy with that change, but we wanted to provide a bit more flexibility by allowing the Pawn to become any piece.*

**Patch notes v1.5**

* Pawn buff: Pawns can now move two spaces forward if they have not yet moved.

*Developer note: We wanted to speed up the early game and make sure players can get right into the action, so we're buffing the early game Pawn.*

**Patch notes v1.5.1**

* New Pawn Special Ability ""En Passant"": Immediately after a pawn moves two spaces, if it could have been captured by an opposing pawn if it had only moved one space, that opposing pawn can still capture it as if it had only moved one space.

*Developer note: We expect this to be a controversial patch. We want to keep the pawn's special two-space move, but we're seeing that players are using it to bypass their opponent's defenses. We think this will strike the right balance between mobility and defense. Please let us know what you think!*

**Patch notes v1.6**

* King Ultimate Ability, now called ""Castling"": Once per game, if the King and a Rook have not yet moved, the King can move two spaces toward the Rook, and the Rook can be placed on the other side of the King.

*Developer note: This is a refinement of the King's ult that further protects the King while preventing it from using the ult offensively.*

**Patch notes v1.7**

* Pawn nerf: Pawns can now be promoted only to any already captured piece.

**Patch notes v1.8**

* Pawn buff: Pawns can now once again be promoted to any piece, regardless of whether it's been captured.

**Patch notes v1.9**

* BUG FIX: We discovered a bug where the King could use its Castle ability with a newly promoted rook on the other side of the board. This was unintended and has been patched. Kings can now only Castle with rooks on the same rank.

**Patch notes v2.0**

* BUG FIX: We discovered an exploit where players could promote pawns to a piece of the opponent, potentially blocking the opponent's King and forcing wins or stalemates in obscure situations. This bug has been removed, and pawns can now only be promoted to a piece of the same color, as originally intended.

1589,Can we please get some regulations around high disparity between ranks?,"It's really annoying to end up on the same team as a Divine 4 and an Archon 2. There are like 24 ranks between them, the gap should be way smaller. Either you get stomped because you have one player who's nowhere near everyone else in the team, or you might get carried by a ""smurf"" who goes mid and stomps, either way it's not a fun game. I don't play to gain ranks, I play for even and fun matches, that means playing against people around my skill. I don't want to play vs or with people who are 14 ranks above me and 10 ranks below me because they queued together. If you queue together, you should be forced to be close in rank, this is absurd.

Just played an Ancient-ranked game, where we had the Divine player who queued with some obvious beginner who went 0-18 shadow shaman. Just makes no sense, every other game forces you to be close in rank, but in DotA you don't even need smurfs, just queue with people with really low mmr.

**Edit:** I know people are going to say medals =! MMR. But in every single of these games it's quite clear that there is a huge disparity between their actual capabilities.",DotA2
1591,"Jikininki , the spirit of madness. The idea of a new hero.","&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ig3h0516vop21.jpg

    Hello! I have a lot of ideas about new characters in my favorite game. 
    Do you think this hero can exist in the game?
    And I apologize in advance for the level of English of my translator.

Jikininki is a ranged intelligence hero.  He has a good ability to control the enemy. His first ability, ""**Hunger**"", to a certain extent causes the enemy damage to his current health, and reduces HP regeneration and healing by 60% for 6 seconds . Also Jikininki skill restores health in the amount of damage caused to the enemy. The second ability, ""**Fear of Death**"", scares the chosen enemy, forcing him to flee to the base. The third ability, ""**Invisible Evil**"", is passive and makes the hero almost invisible, and also allows him to poison and slow down the enemy when attacking from stealth. The last skill, ""**Spirit of Madness""**, creates an area around the hero in which the enemies go crazy and begin to attack each other. If an enemy leaves the area before the ability expires, his mind will clear up.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/rvjti3o6vop21.png

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;¬†¬†¬†¬†  **Jikininki** very vaguely recalled his past life, even his name was lost, and no one knew the name of this evil spirit during his lifetime. He was born a long time ago in one of the noble houses and from childhood got used to the servants around him. Despite the attempts of his parents to cultivate a good and decent person from him, from childhood their heir showed only the most terrible character traits: he was cruel, rude, closed in himself and loved to mock his servants. With age, everything only worsened, and when parents left this world under mysterious circumstances, the whole village howled from the tyranny and persecution of this monster. He loved to punish for any mistakes with a whip, to torture servants, to make them fight a friend for fun. At a certain point, the  **Jikininki** madness passed to a new level, and he became interested in black magic. Now it was not limited to simple mockery, people began to disappear en masse: small children disappeared from the cradles, women disappeared on the way to the river, and strong men did not return from the forest near the manor. Jikininki‚Äôs face has also changed: his skin has become thinner and grayer, rotten spots have appeared on his face, his body has become dry and twisted, his eyes have become terribly insane. Sometimes he disappeared in his room for several weeks, and it was at such moments that people disappeared in the village. On one of these countless terrible days, when several babies disappeared, the terror of the inhabitants turned into a desire to stop everything, people grabbed forks, sticks, axes and swords and fell into insanity to destroy the estate. The house was burned to the ground, but they did not find **Jikininki** , and his room, when a distraught crowd burst into it, turned out to be surprisingly empty, covered with dust and cobwebs, as if no one lived here. Unsatisfied with revenge, people began to search, and after a couple of hours of walking from the estate, they found a hut in the forest, filled to the ceiling with the remains of all the missing people. Behind the hut they saw **Jikininki** , bewitched by the body of the missing child, covered with blood. Do we need to talk about how strong the fear and disgust of the crowd was at the sight of this picture? With rage, people attacked the monster, beat and stabbed him. But at some point one of the lumberjacks suddenly turned and struck his neighbor with an ax, another warrior stopped the sword in the backswing and aimed the blade at his friend. The crowd began to beat itself, and through the cries of pain and the sound of weapons came the angry and inanimate laughter of the creature, which crawled into the forest. His mind was different, not human, part of the bloodied body began to dissolve in the air, his eyes burned with red fire, and his lips whispered: ""I finished the ritual, I reached."" Nobody returned from the forest to the village. Other people fled from this cursed place, leaving behind their homes and property. And even when the ashes and the village disappeared over the centuries and became part of the dense forest, and the story of the bloodthirsty **Jikininki** became just a scary story for the children of neighboring villages, no one dared to spend the night in the forest, because many people were missing. But, those lucky ones who were lucky enough to return, became uncommunicative and frightened old men. They said they saw something from the other world in the forest. This creature was driving people crazy, forcing them to kill each other, and then eating corpses.

# Abilities:

&amp;#x200B;

[Hunger](https://i.redd.it/edh8or4avop21.jpg)

**Ability**: Target enemy unit

**Damage**: magical

**Range of use**: 550

**Damage**: 15% / 17% / 18% / 20 of the current health of the enemy.

**Treatment**: 15% / 17% / 18% / 20 of the current amount of enemy Hp.

**Reduces the recovery of the target's health**: 70%

**Duration**: 6

**Cooldown**: 20/17/15/13

&amp;#x200B;

Deals magical damage to the enemy in the amount of a certain percentage of his current health, and also reduces the recovery of the target's health by 60% for 6 seconds. The ability restores the health of the spirit in an amount equal to the damage inflicted on the enemy.

*Note: counts the amount of damage in% ratio of hp lost by the enemy and recovers equivalently xp to the hero. That is, if you use the ability on an enemy from 2000 current HP, then the damage done to him at the last skill level will be 400 HP. On 400 hp the spirit will recover.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Fear of Death](https://i.redd.it/rhz2acgbvop21.jpg)

**Ability**: Target enemy unit

**Range of use**: 400

**Duration**: 2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 4 seconds

**Cooldown**: 25/21/18/15.

Frightens the selected creature and makes him run to the base for a certain time.

*Note: does not affect units invulnerable to magic. Dispelled by basic cleansing.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Invisible Evil](https://i.redd.it/14stk2rcvop21.jpg)

**Ability**: Passive

**Time to invisibility after the attack**: 4/3/2/1.5

**Damage to the enemy in a second**: 20/32/45/60

**The duration of the poisoning of the enemy**: 3/4/5/6

**Slow down the enemy movement speed**: 15/18/22/25%

Jikininki merges with the environment, it becomes almost invisible to enemies. When struck from invisibility, he poisons the enemy and slows his speed. Poisoning and slowing down the enemy is possible every 20 seconds.

*Note: Jikininki invisibility is not absolute, like other heroes. Enemies see the shadow and traces of the spirit, blurred (almost invisible to the eyes) outlines of the body. The model of the hero under the influence of this ability should be made so that it would be difficult to notice with a quick glance, but with proper observation the enemy would understand that the spirit is near. In addition, the spirit can not be taken in the goal as long as it is not under the action of  Dust of Appearance,  Sentry Ward.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Spirit of Madness](https://i.redd.it/41dh3yrhvop21.jpg)

**Ability**:  No Target

**Radius**: 400

**Duration**: 3 / 3,5 / 4

**Cooldown**: 100/90/80

The hero reveals his invisibility and becomes the center of madness, forcing the enemies around him to attack each other. If an enemy leaves an area of ‚Äã‚Äãability before the expiration of an ability, his mind will clear up.

*Note: Dzikininki can move, use other abilities and items during the skill action. But while the ability works, it is visible to the enemies. Enemies that fall into the range of ability, begin the search for the nearest victim (priority characters) also within the range of ability. That is, they ignore goals that are not affected by insanity. If the enemy kills his ally when the ability is active, he goes on to search for the next target.*

*If the enemy leaves the zone of action, his mind will clear up. But in a random way this will happen only if Dzikininki moves too fast and the enemy falls out of the zone. Otherwise, the ability acts on the enemy in such a way that his movement algorithm prohibits him from leaving the range of the ability, and he will try to move only inside the circle around Dzikininki.*

*A hero who has fallen under the action of an ability can be driven out of the range of ability with the help of Nether Swap, Force Staff, etc. Then the effect of madness will be dispelled. Conversely, if you change the location of the enemy and place within the range of sposbnosti, he will also fall under the influence of madness and begin to attack his allies in the field of ability.*

So, if it's a decent or good Game for Invoker I will pick him, but say someone counterpicks before I do. So my question is:

1618,Region Slots for this Major,"I'm sure this has been mentioned a few times but i'll say it again so its actually different next time. The quality of NA dota aside from EG falls dramatically which makes sense because there are much fewer players, they play League and other games. The max NA should get for any tournament is 2 slots.

Europe and China should both be minimum 3 slots.

Now the question is who should get the last slot? It can be either SEA or CIS. In this case I think TNC should have gotten the third slot. Otherwise reserve two slots for minor tournament winners/runner ups.

I know in the long run it may not make a difference, the team may get knocked out early on etc. but in  terms of the quality of dota we know which regions are stronger and which have stronger teams, hence they deserve the small prize money.

Hope you make the changes, Thanks",DotA2

1636,Playing one time peer week and getting better to increase mmr?,"Hey, just wanna share my last experience from my last year.

&amp;#x200B;

I was actually playing dota 2-4 time a day and got my mmr from 3,5k to 4,4k in some months.

I always play as pos 5 and pos 3 (nature and dark seer spammer, no shame).

&amp;#x200B;

I got my first job last year, and since i've started i can only play at the weekends.

The first thing that i noticed was my reaction time and mechanical skills that got really rusted. My mmr drop from 4500 to 3800. I couldn't follow 100% the patchs and metas during that time, so basically i couldn't be 100% efficient in the matches.  


Until the last calibration my mmr was stuck in the 3900 range. But lucky in the new season i got calibrated as Ancient 7 4900 (i couldn't believe at first). After some months playing and some loss and wins i got Divine 1 (4926). My goal is to reach Immortal rank, but for that i know that i need to get better and improve overall skills and unfortunately i can't spend all my time on that.

1642,"New kind of scam, watch out! Fake Jackpots. Don't fall for a fake trading site","So, basically a random guy added me to steam, and he told me:

&gt; So i have a deal for you, I wont ask you for your items ,money or any shit like that. Profit 50/50,it will take about 15-20mins. Can I tell you about it?

&gt; Im member of support on https://d2flex.com , and I have access to the admin panel, where I can choose winners,but theres a problem

&gt; I cant do it for myself, because owner of site blocked bets from my IP address, steam profiles etc. However, I can choose another people, for example - you as a winner, but then you give me 50% of winnings, which you take
	U participate in the jackpot,i make u win and we split items u win 50/50. This is the plan

His domain was made just a week ago: https://i.imgur.com/0YRw3hv.png - but he was pretending like it was some legitimate trading / gambling site

Sounded like a scam, so I figured why not scam bait him for a while, see what's up.

Well, first he wanted to show me proof that what he was saying was true, so he ""predicted"" a bunch of people that would win

First he said a guy called UMBRA would win, and then he did: https://i.imgur.com/5TvEBCa.png

Then he said someone called ""-TOO- Merkaba"" would win, which he did: https://i.imgur.com/TmzWuWy.png

So, he did proof that he actually does own the site, and can manipulate the results

He tried to get me to login with my main account for a while, which I did not want to do, because I didn't wanna risk losing anything accidentally. I don't know how much he can do through the steam API after I'm logged in. So I was claiming for a while that it did not work on my main account. Then said I'd try a different account:

https://i.imgur.com/9zx5O9Q.png

The different account did no have an authenticator, so from there on out I could not see what I wanted to do

https://i.imgur.com/qF284RS.png

but I assume the scam is that he get's me to ""trade"" some items on that website that he owns, steals them, and bails...

Here is his profile: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198870470644/

At some point he send me a friend request from his ""main account"" which is https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197963653930/

(side-note for the chatlog: 'I'm not actually retarded, I'm just pretending' - I'm a professional software developer and I knew what I was doing.. you probably shouldn't try this at home and bait people like this yourself, you might risk losing things)

Just wanted to warn you guys. Its a pretty sophisticated scam. The guy actually does own the website, and can make it seem like people are winning jackpots.

1. Buy Arcana in the game store, its more expensive but its sure to get it all

2 . Buy the Arcana Bundle in the market place, its cheaper but i dont know if i get it all and if i should look for gems or anything before purchasing. 

3. Buying separate itens of the Arcana on the market, should be even cheaper but again i dont know where to look for gems or if is even possible to get the effects this way.

I love dota but, I suck at it, so for anything even remotely high level I watch the pro games. The optics seem to be that it is very, very top heavy which has turned off some of my friends to watching since any given year you can guess who is going to TI and who will win the majors whith who wins TI being the only real exception to this.

Over the weekend I was at a gaming convention in Albany, NY where they had simultaneous fortnite, overwatch and LoL tourneys going being played my local colleges. I noticed that with fortnite they would have duos running but a team of players that they would swap out in those two active spots. It added a huge variety to match.

My thought was what if dota rosters flexed to 7 players. With the extra 2 having minimum play requirements in the tourney (say like a minimum  Bo3 each). This would help get tier 2 players expierance with the top players and more exposure while also cutting down on stand-ins and player fatigue (I saw some people bring this up as VP lost to ViCi last major). This would also introduce some upsets as tier 2 teams play against a team like secret with one or both of their alternates in. 

I would love to here the feedback. Maybe there is a bunch i am missing that would make this inworkable.",DotA2
1668,Suggestion: People sent to Chess low priority should be required to win Candyland games instead of Chess960 games,"Look, we all want to curb toxicity in our chess games, and the best way to do that is with a proper punishment system.

The reason?

People in chess LP still get to play chess.

By changing LP to Candyland, you are taking away the one thing people actually want to play and replacing it with a much more unpleasant experience.

1678,Dota2 Tournament - 1v1 mid,"Hi All,

I am organizing a 1v1 mid Dota2  Tournament; it is a ""test"" tournament. What I mean with ""test"" is that the number of participants is small, 16, and there are some ad-hoc rules that I would like to try before make a bigger event.

For instance,on game 1 players have to agree on which hero to pick (*between Pudge, Invoker, Shadow Fiend, Queen of Pain, Lina*). From game 2, the loser of game 1 can pick any hero. 

Game are best of 3 and players must pick the same hero. For the complete rules, [click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vT-8nCeSTIsA6SAlXk6BdHMShjVvCxkKp_23iidNU0I/edit?usp=sharing).

The pre-registration can be done via [toornament](https://www.toornament.com/tournaments/2280768022924296192/information); the whole tournament should end in 5-6 weeks. 

The entry fees is 10$+2$: 10$ goes into the prize pool whereas the 2$ are for the administration fees. Every week there will be a ""game day"" (THU) where players will play at least 2 matches; myself and other administrators will follow the matches to make sure everything runs smoothly.

**MY BACKGROUND**

I have been organizing sport leagues and tournament for the past 15 years; as a dota player, I have always wanted to create a dota tournament, so I decided to start with this small event. Regarding the entry fees, it has been a choice driven by experience: people is more likely to commit when they are economically involved (i.e. it avoids leave the tournament, do not turn up, etc). Moreover, it adds more ""thrill"" to the competition :)",DotA2

1685,"10+ Years of DOTA, trying to be better - How do I improve?","I'll do my best not to go into a long rant here. I've played DOTA on and off for many years. When League of Legends came out I switched to that, then switched to DOTA 2 and played since the closed beta. The large majority of that time I played pretty casually just aiming to have fun with a group of friends and never really focus to try and be better. Until recently.

&amp;#x200B;

The highest I've been was slightly over 4k mmr. I feel as though my knowledge, mechanics and general strategy are okay, but can't seem to win. (So I'm clearly not as good as I think) I've looked up every guide I could find, watched many hours of coaching sessions on YouTube (3.5-4k mmr) but don't feel like I'm improving.  


TL:DR

I'm hoping one of you can steer me in the right direction or inform me of something I'm oblivious to needing to work on to get better at DOTA 2.

1692,A support player's harrowing journey to try to learn carry,"I play support. I'm a real bad player, barely 2k. During a pause I saw the tip that said ""Playing a carry makes you a better support player and vice versa"" So I figured hey, why not, lets play some carry to become a better support. So I queued as safe lane and now, an afternoon and 6 lost games later I have to ask, why do people like this role?

You have to endure some of the world's worst early games. On the other side of the lane there is an offlaner who has like triple your attack damage and a faster attack animation so good luck getting any last hits or denies.

 And you don't even get to play Dota. Instead you play the click creeps- minigame for god knows how long. You stare at the descending health bars for so long that your fingers start hurting from having to be in a constant state of tension cause if you click even a fraction of a second late, you're not getting that last hit. Your eyes get red from not blinking cause those health bars go down fast, gotta learn the fucking exact millisecond when you have to attack. If I wanted to hit things at exact moments with a big punishment for missing, I'd play Guitar Hero. Fuck that. 

So then you finish your item only to realize that you're not gonna be getting anything done in a team fight because you need that stupid ass item BKB. So back to clicking creeps for an eternity just so you can actually play the game for 10 seconds. I mean 9 seconds. I mean 8^seconds^actually 7 seconds^No really its 6^5seconds

And even if you click on the health bars well enough to get your item, your mandatory ""play Dota for 10 seconds with this"" -membership card, what do you get to do? Click on heroes instead of creeps! Just attack move to the other side of the team fight and lay back in your chair and watch as your character deals a billion damage per second without you having to do a thing. Exciting point and click adventure! 

Oh and speaking of team fights, you know who wants to target you first? Who wants to counter your pick specifically so that not even your precious detour-from-actual-fun-items BKB is gonna save you? Who wants to gank you during the laning stage relentlessly? Fucking everybody, that's who. Can't let that safe lane carry have a fun today, no sir! And then your team has the audacity to yell at you for only completing that battlefury at 18 minutes. Like yeah, I had to lane against complete early game monsters, what do you want me to do, go sacrifice 80% of my health for a single last hit? Didn't see you teleport a single time when I got dived for the 3rd time. Fucking Invoker players right? 

So after all of that, who gets all the blame and flame once everything falls apart? Who gets reported even though your only crime was not clicking on creeps fast enough? You do, my friend, you do. 

So did playing carry make me a better support player? I don't know, probably not. It made me realize however that the reason why carry players are so often the ones to blame their team is because they're not playing dota. They're playing Click Creeps 3000, and very different rules apply there. 

Thanks for reading. Hopefully you got atleast a chuckle out of my misery. Good night and take care.

1725,Why is castling a thing???,Why the fuck is castling a legitimate thing???Seriously???? Oh here let me just magically have two pieces jump over each other and place them anywhere in the row and do two moves in one. Makes no fucking sense unlike the rest of the other moves in the game! Beyond broken!!!!,DotA2
1727,Why does NA still have 3 slots? [Serious],"Im in NA and love NA dota but our t2 scene is dogshit and I think getting a 3rd slot is waste. Obviously being able to play with better teams grows the scene, but is the DPC a charity for the NA t2 scene? It should be based on merit.

If you look at the current DPC rankings, you would think NA should get the 3rd slot, but the region only has some teams in there because they got into the major through the 3rd slot. I am a student with lots of free time, so I get to watch a lot of dota, and NA t2 is much weaker than all the other regions' t2 scenes except SA (even then they are not that far behind NA).

This 3rd NA slot could go to any another region. CIS and SEA are the first options. I would pick CIS right now because there are a few teams that have shown top level play including Gambit, Old but Gold, Navi, and Empire (we will have to see how they fare at the major).

The extra slot could even go to China giving them 4 slots, but I think maxing regions to 3 allows all the regions to have better representation.

Tbh, the real reason I think NA still has 3 slots is because Valve is lazy as fuck, and they haven't bothered to change anything because its not that big of a deal.",DotA2
1728,2.8k easier then 1.1k,"low behavior score 1.1k acc - 9 losing streak playing support dazzle my best hero that I went 21/4 w/l recently on my main. Can't believe I climbed out of that hell this is legit harder then where my main is at now, and the worst thing is mid is impossible to get.  ",DotA2
1729,New to chess. Am I missing something?,"So, bit of background, I started with League of Checkers and moved into Backgammon before the removal of the BG Pro Circuit totally killed the community. Finally decided to bite the bullet and join the big leagues with Chess.

So, first is a meta question. Have we always had this 15p1 strat so dominant? It seems like every game I play the King is demanding ward vision and sacrificial plays just to survive so he can, what, move a single square at a time? Even Pawns do that and we have 8 of them so what's the big deal? I guess it's just not connecting for me, cause in Checkers basically everyone starts as a Pawn and can be Kinged (our term for ""promoted"" lol) into a King.

Speaking of which, second, it seems like I'm almost never getting to promote my Pawns. Are my games just not going late enough to get that level of farm, or is there like a combo I can pull off with en passants to make sure I'm getting into the right position? I don't expect to promote every Pawn every game til I have more experience, but it feels like it should be happening way way more.

Third, Knights are just overpowered, right? Their flanking moves are just always putting them into positions where I'm having trouble predicting what's next. Is this just a degenerate strat I'm going run into at my ELO? Relatedly, I've seen people mostly promote to Queens, why aren't they just taking Knights?

Anyway, thanks in advance for your help!",DotA2
1730,"En passant is fine, the pawn ultimate is actually broken.","Who's idea was it to let a hero just transform into any other hero with all their abilities?  This one ability is almost always enough to just win on the spot.  It makes you focus so much attention on this one hero who can just Press R and win.

Absolutely ridiculous.",DotA2
1731,"Transitioning from League to DOTA, Confused about Macro","I've played League for over six years, been getting burnt out as of late. Experimented with other MOBAs like HotS and Dawngate (anyone remember that?), but always admired DOTA as a more demanding MOBA, yet struggled to get into it. I understand a lot of the micro like handling multiple units, farming and denying, blocking and pulling creeps, etc; my main struggle is understanding the macro of DOTA, being so used to LoL's laning dynamics, and its transition into the teamfight phase, while DOTA still seems really foggy and confusing in that regard.

In League, I main ADC (first position, I think it's called in DOTA), though I'm fine at any position other than jungle. Played about 150 games of DOTA scattered over the last couple years, learning what heroes I like, but never got used to laning. Laning in LoL revolves around trades, dealing small amounts of damage to the enemy which add up over time until they're low enough for an all-in, while in DOTA you can't really do that because of high mana costs and hefty minion aggro, unless you take a hero that specializes in it like TA, Luna, Zeus, or Sniper. Generally, every engagement is either a one-sided burst combo (Lina), a skirmish involving full rotations of spells or several attacks, or a full on kill commitment (preferably with a gank). I might be missing something, but it just feels like a feast or famine dynamic with massive snowballing once one side gets ahead, and that doesn't feel very satisfying, even when I'm the one feasting. If there's a different way to approach laning, I'm not aware of it, or at least I've had no success attempting it.

I also struggle to see when the laning phase ends and team fight phase begins, if DOTA even has phases comparable to those of LoL. In League, laners start roaming more once they take their first tower, and grouped pushes start happening frequently once most or all of the first tier towers are down, also often grouping for Nashor. It could just be because I'm very low elo in DOTA and have equally confused teammates, but I never see a clear phase transition in DOTA, which makes learning how I'm supposed to progress in the game when much more difficult to understand.

I've watched Purge for a long time, but even watching gameplay hasn't really illuminated these things for me, especially since casual play looks very different than high level play. I'm just wondering if there's any advice I could get on the macro of this game, so I actually know what I'm supposed to be doing when rather than running around the map like a chicken with its head cut off until teamfights start happening.",DotA2
1732,Would a team of 6k MMR player dominate TI1 ?,"Been watching some old nostalgic videos in youtube and realised that many pro players from ti1 have extremely sloppy movement.

This is not what is happening at all. Instead we get matched with smurfs 100% of the time. Now i don't mind playing with or against players that are good but the thing is that they are new accounts. So these players don't mind throwing. They throw everytime they find something that they don't like. Not getting roles, dying once when supports don't tp or team not following them when they run in a suicide mission. Its just too much. I am a student and when i get to play dota this is it 100% of the time. Either i queue ranked where i have to try my absolute best or unranked where i can't even play casually. Its just too frustrating so please Valve make it so that we get queued with players that are not new accounts and players that don't throw.

I played two game in my off time today and both games new accounts. I thought it would be fine and competition would be high as they were obviously smurfs. But halfway they just throw the game because they don't care and they can just make new accounts and this affects us players that have been on one account and reduce quality for both of us.

1822,Who would want to read a book about Dota? And what would they want in it?,"Hi everyone. I hope that this isn't too unusual a question for the subreddit, but I was would like to gauge interest in a potential book about Dota and what people would like to see in it.

The reason I ask this is that Dota has been a pretty big part of my life over the last three or four years, and I have often wondered how I could best contribute to the community. I don't play very well and never will; and I don't have the skill set to do video, as many other talented people do on Youtube and Twitch, etc. But I was a journalist for ten years, and I think that Dota - and esports in general - is missing a good non-fiction book that would be of interest to both people who play the game, as well as a more general audience that know that esports is a big thing, but don't really know how to find out about it. I have been thinking about what that book might look like.

The model might lie in books about extreme/niche sports - such as mountaineering and long-distance running. These are activities that can take over people's lives and put them through extraordinarily difficult situations. Telling the stories of hardcore mountaineers and the community that they are in, or crazy runners is kind of cool; and I think these books resonate well with people who participate in these sports, and people who are interested in this kind of lifestyle. The only problem I foresee is there is something viscerally compelling about someone who lost three fingers and two toes to climb Everest. Fucking up your shoulder sitting in front of the computer and playing too much DOTA, doesn't really have the same impact...

The stories of individual players could give the book a sense of narrative (but avoiding the ""OMFG people play video games for money!!!"" angle that you tend to find when non-specialist media writes about esports). The business angle of things is very interesting, and the more I find out by talking to people in the industry, the more I realise how little good info is out there (i.e. it tends to be hearsay online). And then there is the game itself, because DOTA is such a uniquely special game, it would be crucial to highlight what makes people coming back to the game after accumulating many thousands of hours over several years (something my non-gaming friends don't get at all). The mysterious story of Ice Frog is also very very cool.

Do you think something like this might work? Are there any books you might suggest that might be a good example? (i read lot of non-fiction, but never anything about sport). I'd be really interested in hearing your feedback.

https://i.redd.it/imeyzz1kolp21.jpg

So I had this avatar set as an ironic profile pic on my account, I thought it would make for some funny responses from players who saw it. I load up steam today and for some reason it was removed from my profile, and it says I can't make changes to my profile until April 28? What gives valve?! How is this picture offensive to you?! Some triggered russian probably reported it and valve banned it?! But how is this even offensive?!?!?! I'm trying to understand. Any clarification on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Just wanted to mention the fact that I often get accounts that are clearly being boosted (meepo spam and 5-6 rank ups in the past week), and obvious account buyers (legend or archon last season, divine this season, play like a 2k going 0-7 on mid at 12 minutes in the game), and I always report them. Somehow, nothing is ever done to those account buyers and boosters, but somehow my profile pic gets removed and I can't change my avatar for 30 days?!",DotA2

1838,What are some of the best/worst/most creative insults you've either received or seen in Dota 2?,"During my 759 hour journey so far in Dota 2, I have seen many an insult. Some of them average, others being extraordinary. Some of them from pros and some of them from newbies. Some LC Mains and some Meepo Smurfs. It does not matter if the person is American, Russian or Spanish, as insults come from all kinds of people! It can be just one simple sentence or an entire paragraph of rage, as well!

With this out of the way, I ask you today, r/DotA2, what are some of the best/worst/most creative insults you've either seen or received during your time so far playing Dota 2?

1840,The worst griefer I have encountered in my almost 3k hours in dota. I need help Kindly review this.,"Match ID: 4597593209

&amp;#x200B;

Griefer played as: Riki

&amp;#x200B;

What griefer did:

&amp;#x200B;

afk (lvl 6 the whole game)

&amp;#x200B;

bought all the wards and placed them on top of our jungle camps (blocking them).

&amp;#x200B;

called out all times I tried to rosh (I play as Ursa this game, so rosh is a big deal).

&amp;#x200B;

griefed courrier.

&amp;#x200B;

tried to farm rapier to feed to the enemy team.

&amp;#x200B;

Bought all the tomes.

&amp;#x200B;

Fed himself.

&amp;#x200B;

Was being toxic and bad mouthed the whole game.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried several times to calm him down, but he wanted to prove his point

(that necro buying his tome in the beginning would ruin the game for us, it would not)

&amp;#x200B;

Please, I beg of you, if you read this. Watch the demo and help me get this to someone that can do something about it. 

That was my 4-5th game in a row and I have only had griefers today. My ""social score"" in

dota is 6,769. I should not be getting people like this in my game. I really try hard, and this ruins it for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I have almost 3k hours in dota, and this is by far the worst I have ever seen anyone grief.

It was not possible for me as an ursa player to do anything this game. He shut down all the possibilities

I could think of.",DotA2

1847,About gambling Site promotion by players,sorry for this guys but it just my opinion. I think players or teams shouldn't promote gambling sites (eg : adding the gambling site address beside their ID) because Dota played by a lot players who are not even 18yrs or 21yrs old. I see a lot of teams doing this and i feel like its wrong. A lot of kids might get addicted to it. Just my 2 cents.,DotA2

1880,"Position Six Podcast featuring lizZard - talking about the difficulty balancing playing with casting, his 'persona' (or lack thereof) as a talent, the Dreamleague Major and much more.","Hello all!

I've released the latest episode (episode 21) of the Position Six Podcast, with one of the most exciting new casters and analysts, lizZard.

We spoke about the difficulty trying to be both a pro and a talent at the same time - and his belief in being a pro - how lizZard sees himself on screen, the Dreamleague Major, the weaknesses and struggles of the Balkans and much more.

Sorry to those of you who have been patiently waiting for the past 2 weeks for new episodes, I had a tonne of technical difficulties outside of my control and a guest let me down. I'm back on track now.

1885,Charity Stream for Kitties !,"Hey guys, I'm bowie! You might know me from my youtube videos or more recently for some of my casts. 

For a while I've been looking for a way to give back all the love I found within the dota community. I remember a lot of charity streams in the past that were awesome and had great goals but I never found an org that I would like to give back to.

Until a friend of mine (one that saw the beginning) of my dota journey move to the city I live now. We used to live together because of college and even adopted this beautiful [fluffy ball](https://imgur.com/UHjRDyY) together . Her name is Kira and we adopted it through a local and small cat org called [gato miah](https://www.facebook.com/gatomiah/) . They might be small but they do a great job at it. They're all about ""responsible adoption"" meaning they want to know whether you have the means from reasonable wealth to provide the cat a good life to a residence with the appropriate nets to prevent the cat to run away.

They visited us and the process was amazing. I loved every second with this cat and my friend takes amazing care of her to this day. So yeah the goal here is to raise money for them so they can keep doing their job !

Their job is amazing because they're not only looking to find homeless cats owners. First they take care of all the ""problems"" that they might have from castrating them to any medical issues and they even try to pair the cats personalities with the owner! They help people that lost their cats to find them using their [page](https://scontent.fgru5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/55803425_2105654636168194_2443775407183364096_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fgru5-1.fna&amp;oh=96deefdd6447643ddeb4c337ed987eac&amp;oe=5D08064C)

My stream will be 12-24h long. I would like to say I'm 100% committing to 24h but since I never did it that's why I'm leaving it open and here's how things will work:

* **I will only play heroes that can summon creatures that are controlable : Beastmaster, Broodmother, Chen, Enigma, LD, Lycan, NP, Visage, Warlock.** 
* **For every Loss I will donate 5 dolars from my own pocket to them.**
* **Chat will be able to select which hero I'll play every game from an interactive poll but I will never play the same hero twice in a row**

* **All the money that comes from donations during the stream will also be directed towards gato miah**

* **The stream will happen on April 17 (Wednesday) time yet to be decided in my [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/d2bowi3)**

1886,"Valve, please clean-up your cosmetics","There‚Äôs so many cosmetics that have broken or glitched out over the years, it‚Äôs really quite sad. This is almost entirely the way this game is monetized and it‚Äôs shameful to see real money items, often costing good money, that break and don‚Äôt get fixed.",DotA2
1895,A message to players in lower brackets,"Supports

Please stop blocking the first wave on the safelane. The enemy creeps end up under tower and the lane equilibrium is fucked, and a level 1 core can't farm them. Stop drawing aggro from creeps by harrassing the enemy if they're solo. The lane will push and they'll get exp and farm under the safety of their tower, or close to it, that they shouldn't. Stop hanging around the lane if your core can manage it on their own. Pull creeps if the lane gets pushed in.

I know practically nobody plays this role as a choice in this bracket, but when you do play it, do it right. These things make a lot of difference and they matter.

Everyone, stop taking the courier from mid when they need it. Manage your resources such that you won't. Take a close look at the side-shop, don't ever buy those items at the start of the game or bring them on the courier, unless you really can't visit the thing.  The mid's courier usage is the most important at this stage in the game. It's a 1v1 and whoever wins it will set the pace of the game until the main core farms up. This is extremely important to understand. Roam mid if you can actually do something, but don't go there on your Pudge to steal exp and c/s a bunch of creeps.

Cores, stop farming jungle for no reason. Lanes need pushing, towers need defending. The only scenario where you should farm jungle is if it's unsafe to do anything else on the map. The moment  that one hero that kills you shows on the map, go straight to a different lane and push it/farm it/pressure it into their towers. This will elicit a response from the enemy team, they'll have to rotate heroes to defend and that will open up space for you to farm elsewhere.

Stop using your TPs stupidly. They have a very long cooldown. You want to get the most value out of your TP, so using it to place yourself somewhere you could have simply walked is a really dumb idea. A TP can function as freedom of choice. You can either do this, or that. But if you use it for nothing, the choice is gone. You're now stuck to where you TP-ed for 80 seconds. It's either that or walk right back to where you TP-ed from, either case means wasted time and opportunities. Having it off-cooldown means you can be instantly active when and where it matters.",DotA2
1896,Some statistics surrounding qualifier slots.,"**Average placement for the Majors:**

NA: (7+7+13+3+9+13+3+9+9)/9 = 8,11

CIS: (1+13+13+2+2+13)/6 = 7,33

EU: (4+9+13+1+7+13+2+4+9)/9 = 6,88

China: (1+5+5+13+4+5+7+13+5+7+13)/11 = 7,09

SEA: (13+7+5+5+9+3+9)/7 = 7,29

SA: (9+9+9+9+9+13)/6 = 9,67

**Average placement for Minors:**

NA: (7+5+5+3)/4 = 5

CIS: (2+2+2+3)/4 = 2,25

EU: (7+5+5+4+5)/5 = 5,2

China: (3+3+1+7+1)/5 = 3

SEA: (1+7+7)/3 = 5

SA: (7+5+4)/3 = 5,33

When considering placements with more than one team at the same tier, all were considered the highest spot, so 13 was the lowest possible placement for majors, and 7th for minors.

**Ranking for Majors:**

EU&gt;China&gt;SEA&gt;CIS&gt;NA&gt;SA

**Ranking for Minors:**

CIS&gt;China&gt;NA=SEA&gt;EU&gt;SA

**Compared to the next Major &amp; Minor invites:**

Disneyland got 3 EU slots. Completely fair, they're the best on average. 3 China is also fair, they're the second best on average. But somehow, NA, the second worst region on average, gets 3 slots as well?

Same story with the minor. China getting 2 slots is fair, but EU, the second worst performing region in minors on average, gets 2 slots?

NA's major slot should go to SEA and EU's minor slot should go to CIS.

If you want to complain that outliers like VP affect the average too much, that's fine.",DotA2

1932,Dota crashing PC,"Dota occasionally (around 30% of the time) crashes my PC when I quit the game. Anyone else have this problem or have any fix to it? 

The only way I can fix it is by a full restart which is far from ideal.",DotA2
1934,"You may not like it, but this is what peak ranked performance looks like.","Today, at pick phase [enemy PA](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/865210524/matches) typed in all chat ""Gonna pay you 10k rubles (~160$) if someone will pick NP and feed me"". This looked like joke, until [player in our team] (https://www.dotabuff.com/players/367111239/matches) agreed, picked NP and started feeding.

&amp;nbsp;

Obviously, there was almost no hope to win this and [PA ended 44/0, while NP ended 0/30](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/4611529632).
&amp;nbsp;
Quick investigation lead to this matches, where ""YA GEI"" and ""koko-jambo"" both ended in same team, while not being in party.

[Match 4611192125](https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/4611192125)

&amp;nbsp;

But, this thread not about this particular smurfers or whatever term is right there. And since I remember that there is no right place other than Reddit to ask Valve something, I just wanna ask a single question one more time ‚Äî **When Valve will provide us a tool to report blatant game ruiners?**. 


There is only 3 steps needed:

1. Mark people who got reported in same **ranked** match by **8+ different** players from both sides.

2. After 3-5 successful marks **per month** (or three months, whatever feels right) check marked players and initiate checking their matches for ""unusual activity"".

3. ""Unusual activity"" could include several tests like:

 - swings in KDA, GPM, XPM, (maybe APM if this is so important).

 - some keywords in allchat/teammates chat.

 - some rare checks like number of courier kills (5+), time of first blood and number of heroes participated in it.

&amp;nbsp;

You may say that this system would have multiple false positive alarms &gt;!like Gosu.AI!&lt; when people would report Arteezy or Bulldog just for fun, but recheck all 3 points above and you'll see that this would happen in far less than 0.5% of matches. Considering number of reports available per week and number of Venoms in this game number of false positives would be even less. 
&gt;!Plot twist: Valve will remove Random Draft from MMR search!&lt;

&amp;nbsp;

**tldr:** two friends somehow abusing game search ruining other people's game and noone can prevent this since reporting system doesn't work. Or probably I'm to impatient and can't wait for new reliability system.

1937,"i just had a guy disconnect because he lost in pick stage, game does not count?","Some games look pretty grim just from the draft. Why does dota allow players to just abandon before first blood to make the game not count? some dude actually just abandoned because they had nothing against my pl pick, i feel cheated. I doubt he is going to care for some lp games if it means he can protect his mmr.",DotA2
1938,ESL One Mumbai attendance!,"Hello,

I'm an Australian solo travelling through India, currently working out my next destinations, I'm thinking of attending ESL One Mumbai while I'm in the country.

1940,"Players are still able to purchase relics for 800 shards, even after having collected them all.","Although this might not be necessarily a complaint, warning, feature, bug or even a notice, it's something that falls in between all of these categories to an extent. I marked this under discussion to hear your opinions on it.

It could be a feature for the few, if any, that have all of the hero relics for every hero already. However, it's much more likely a flaw that was overlooked. Should DotA still have that as an option? Wouldn't it be better if a notification popped-up and warned ""You have already collected all the available relics for this hero. Are you sure you wish to proceed?"" or something similar.

1954,"Scandal in CIS community: Kodos, Team Empire midlaner accused of cheating in the Major Qualifiers finals","I haven't seen any posts on it yet, however the topic is pretty contraversial. 

# What happened? 

It started with the CIS caster and analyst PGG claiming that he [noticed the signs of cheating](https://clips.twitch.tv/CautiousCrepuscularLemur4Head) in the Team Empire - Na'Vi match. He claimed that Kodos, the midlaner of Team Empire, used cheating software to block the creeps because of too much APM and the ""suspitious black line"" next to the cursor. Team Empire manager Korben and CIS caster 4ce argued PGGs claim. 

V1lat asked pro players and analysts to check out the moment of blocking creeps in more details, and he described the overall reaction as  ""Almost ideal blocking, which currently can be seen only from Open AI bots""

# Further suspitions:

After the hype was brought up, CIS community noticed other moments, which at least require a closer look. 

1) [Euls on Axe on T2 tower](https://youtu.be/01o2CJNnYm8)

2) [Item Drop in the side shop](https://youtu.be/Mq-pOBSRQng)

I don't want to accuse anyone too early and I think it definetely requires an investigation , I'll just leave those clips for you to decide whether cheating took place their or not. 

# Media Reaction

Ilya ""Illidan"" Pivcaev about the creep block - ""it is a regular bind you can set up in 2 seconds, it is not APM or something forbidden. 

Nikita ""4ce"" Kotkov claimed that Kodos clicked Euls on Axe before he jumped, so when the distance got broken by Axe's blink, the Eul got activated

Artem ""fng"" Barshak (Gambit Captain) - said that ""they may face some problems"" but did not say anything particular

Yaroslav ""NS' Kuznetcov (CIS analyst) - ""this black line next to tha cursor is a replay bug. I don't have it, and cheating software does notaffect the replay. Secondly, the guy spent a ton of time training the creep block, and that is not ht eonly thing he is good at in game""

Dmitriy ""Korben"" Belov (Empire manager) - ""Our whole office is laughing. Thanks for hyping on this topic and raising our midlaners self-esteem""

Georgy DrAmer Faleev (Vega Sports Director) called PGG the ""king of 322"" and said that ""Instead of accusing young talents of cheating, PGG should speak out about his oun past performance as a player"". Without firther proof, DrAmer said that he heard from more that 10 people of how corrupted the StarSeries was at some point and how PGG was directly involved in it. ""The worst"", he sais"" is that the big names in CIS Dota are aware of that past of CIS community, and would follow the hate towards Kodos, instead of looking at their own mistakes in the past""

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? It is clear that there is no chating for you, or you think it definetely requires more attention from MDL and Valve?
